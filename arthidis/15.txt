In alternative medicine, medicinal plant preparations have found widespread use 
particularly in the case of diseases not amenable to treatment by modern 
methods. Chemical and phytochemical analyses of Semecarpus anacardium nut reveal 
the presence of biflavonoids, phenolic compounds, bhilawanols, minerals, 
vitamins and amino acids. A variety of nut extract preparations from this source 
are effective against many diseases, viz. arthritis, tumours, infections etc. 
and non-toxic even at high dose of 2000 mg/kg. However understanding of the 
mechanism of the pharmacological action of S. anacardium nut can be greatly 
aided by the isolation of its active principle from the nut and determination of 
the structure-function relationship. Also, the potent curative effect of S. 
anacardium nut extract against human ailments need to be verified by controlled 
clinical studies.
