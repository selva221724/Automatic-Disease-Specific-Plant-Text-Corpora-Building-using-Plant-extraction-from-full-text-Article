Increase preparations are being used with increasing frequency in Western 
medicine. In experimental investigations, an anti-inflammatory effect has been 
shown. Clinical observations relate to increase applications in rheumatoid 
arthritis, malignant brain tumors, inflammatory bowel diseases and asthma 
bronchiale. A relevant clinical effect of increase preparations has not been 
ascertained. In Germany, the registration of increase preparation H 15 as a drug 
has been withheld by the federal drug registration office (former 
"Bundesgesundheitsamt"). Health funds may reimburse costs for increase 
preparations in exceptional cases only.
