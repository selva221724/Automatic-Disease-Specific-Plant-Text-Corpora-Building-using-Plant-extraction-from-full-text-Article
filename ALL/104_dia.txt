A comparison of blood sugar lowering activity of four important medicinal plants 
(Azadirachta indica, Gymnema sylvestre, Catharanthus roseus and Ocimum sanctum) 
were carried out against normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat models. 
The plant extracts decreased the blood sugar level in varying degrees. Blood 
sugar lowering unit (BLU) of activity of each leaf extract and tolbutamide was 
calculated by ED50 values. Statistical analysis revealed significant (P < 0.05) 
variation among the treatments as well as doses with regard to their blood sugar 
lowering capacity. A. indica leaf extract was found to have the most potent 
blood sugar-lowering activity followed by C. roseus, G. sylvestre and O. 
sanctum.
