Medicinal plants belong to the oldest known 
health care products that have been used by human beings all over the world and 
are major components of the formulations used in indigenous system of medicine 
practiced in many countries. Besides, finding place as health supplements, 
nutraceuticals, cosmetics, herbal tea etc. there has been a global insurgence of 
interest, including India, leading to enormous research/activities in the area 
of medicinal plants.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The article is aimed to provide the effort and initiatives of 
ICMR towards research on medicinal plants and its contributions on consolidation 
of Indian research on medicinal plants that are very relevant and important in 
the national context.
METHODS: The various initiatives undertaken by ICMR on research on traditional 
medicines/medicinal plants in the past are reviewed and documented in this 
article.
RESULTS: The multi-disciplinary, multicentric research initiatives of ICMR have 
resulted in validation of traditional treatment Kshaarasootra (medicated 
Ayurvedic thread) for anal fistula, Vijayasar (heart wood of Pterocarpus 
marsupium Roxb.) for diabetes mellitus, encouraging micro- and macrofilaricidal 
activity of Shakotak (stem bark of Streblus asper Lour.) in experimental studies 
an iridoid glycosides fraction isolated from root/rhizomes of Picrorhiza kurroa 
Royle ex Benth. (designated as Picroliv) for viral hepatitis. Other 
developmental and compilation of research works on Indian medicinal plants have 
resulted in publications of the thirteen volumes of quality standards, 
comprising of 449 Indian medicinal plants; three volumes of 90 phytochemical 
reference standards; fifteen volumes of review monographs on 4167 medicinal 
plant species; and one publication each on perspectives of Indian medicinal 
plants for management of liver disorders, lymphatic filariasis and diabetes 
mellitus (details available at http://www.icmr.nic.in/mpsite).
CONCLUSION: The ICMR efforts assume special significance in the light of 
multifaceted use of medicinal plants, and the need of better drugs and remedies 
for various diseases. Further, the indigenous system of medicine, and the plant 
drugs, could promise to provide both concepts of therapy, as well as therapeutic 
agents in the areas, where modern system of medicines has few answers. The 
developement of quality standards and review monographs also help the 
regulators, pharmacopoeial bodies and drug industry towards generation of 
quality herbal drugs or traditional medicine preparations. These initiatives are 
also in favour of the World Health Organisation advocating herbal medicines as a 
valid alternative system of therapy in the form of phytomedicines or herbal 
drugs or herbal drug preparations or herbal medicinal products.
