Cardiospermum halicacabum extracts have been evaluated for their antipyretic 
activity against yeast-induced pyrexia in rats. The ethanol as well as n-hexane 
extracts (400 mg/kg) of the whole plant powder showed potent antipyretic 
activity. The water extract was devoid of significant activity. The antipyretic 
activity of the ethanol extract was concentration dependent.
