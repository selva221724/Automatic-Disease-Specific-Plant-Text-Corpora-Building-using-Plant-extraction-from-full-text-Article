The in vivo effects of insulin, and other insulino mimetic agents like vanadate 
and fenugreek (T. foenum graecum) were followed on the changes in the activities 
of creatine kinase in heart, skeletal muscle and liver of experimental diabetic 
rats. As compared to control rats, creatine kinase activities were found to 
decrease significantly in the tissues during experimental diabetes. All the 
antidiabetic compounds used namely, insulin, vanadate and Fenugreek seed powder 
normalised the decreased activities to almost control values. The effects of 
insulin and vanadate were comparable in restoring normoglycemia and the creatine 
kinase activities.
