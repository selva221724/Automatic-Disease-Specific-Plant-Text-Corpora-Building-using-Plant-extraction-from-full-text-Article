Pedicularis plants (Orobanchaceae), popularly known as lousewort, are found in 
Asia, Europe, and North America, and have been used in Sowa-Rigpa, the Himalayan 
art of healing and a traditional system of medicine for treating various 
ailments in humans. A comprehensive compilation on this valuable medicinal plant 
is not available, however. The present extensive review provides insight into 
the salient medicinal properties of Pedicularis plants with respect to various 
health issues and diseases. Our previous studies on Pedicularis plants from the 
Changthang region of Ladakh (India) and research advances leading to new 
developments in this field have prompted this review. The information presented 
here has been compiled and analyzed from authenticated published resources 
available on Medline, Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Science Direct, and other 
scientific databases. The Pedicularis genus consists of approximately 600 
species (83 of which are found in India), with commonly reported species being 
Pedicularis longiflora Rudolph, P. bicornuta Klotzsch, P. oederi Vahl, P. 
cheilanthifolia, and P. pectinata. The major phytoconstituents of the 
Pedicularis sp. are phenols, phenylethanoids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, 
iridoids, lignans, and alkaloids, among others. The existing literature 
highlights that these compounds possess antioxidant, immunomodulatory, 
anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antifungal, analgesic, 
antitumor, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, muscle-relaxing, antifatigue, 
diuretic, antipyretic, antithrombus, antihemolysis, and DNA-repairing 
properties. This medicinal herb is used in the treatment of leucorrhoea, fevers, 
sterility, rheumatism, general debility, collapse, and urinary problems, and for 
revitalizing the blood circulation, improving digestion, and maintaining 
vitality. This review emphasizes the various medicinal aspects of Pedicularis 
sp. plants containing a variety of phytoconstituents. Besides phenols, 
terpenoids, flavonoids, lignans, tannins, iridoid, and phenylpropanoid 
glycosides are among the active constituents responsible for multiple health 
effects. However, further extensive research is required to characterize the 
various phytoconstituents of Pedicularis to explore their modes of action at a 
molecular level and identify other beneficial applications that can exploit the 
tremendous medicinal potential of this important herb.
