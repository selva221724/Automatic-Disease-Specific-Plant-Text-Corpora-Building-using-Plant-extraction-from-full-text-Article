Glycoside of leucopelargonidin isolated from the bark of F. bengalensis 
demonstrated significant hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and serum insulin raising 
effects in moderately diabetic rats with close similarities to the effects of a 
minimal dose of glibenclamide. The main difference observed in their effects was 
that the former significantly enhanced the fecal excretion of sterols and bile 
acids while the later has no such action even though both controlled 
hypercholesteremia.
