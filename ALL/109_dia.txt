In view of multi-dimensional activity of plant drugs beneficial to complex 
disorders like diabetes, the present study has been undertaken to evaluate the 
effect of aqueous extract of C. peltata roots on serum glucose, lipid profile, 
insulin, inflammatory marker namely tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and 
muscle glycogen in type 2 diabetic rats. Aqueous extract of C. peltata at 40 and 
60 mg/kg dose significantly decreased both the fasting and postprandial blood 
glucose of type 2 diabetic rats; 60 mg/kg dose having more pronounced effect on 
hyperglycemia. An enhanced insulin levels by the aqueous extract is primary for 
its glucose and lipid lowering activity. The extract significantly decreased the 
elevated TNF-alpha in type 2 diabetic rats. The extract at 40 and 60 mg/kg dose 
increased the glycogen levels in skeletal muscle by 58 and 60% respectively. 
Improved glycogen in peripheral tissue such as skeletal muscle indicates the 
ability of plant drug to combat insulin resistance of type 2 diabetes.
