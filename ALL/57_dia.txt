Screening of Madhumehaghna (anti diabetic) plants in Vrihattrayee.

Nanda GC, Padhi MM, Pathak NN, Choppra KK.

The three texts written by Charak, Sushrut and Vagbhat are considered as 
Vrihattrayee because of their original contributions to the basic tenants of 
Ayurveda and innovative uses of plants and medicine. But despite the possibility 
of exploring efficacious for mulations from among these classics, not much 
attempts have been made in this direction, due to the fact that now most of them 
are not in vogue in practice by majority of Ayurvedic physicians. As such, a 
glossary of plants as described in those texts for the management of prameha 
including diabetes has been collected which would be useful for studying these 
drugs from different angles.
