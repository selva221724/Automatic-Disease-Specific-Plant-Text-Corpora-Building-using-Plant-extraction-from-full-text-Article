When normal and alloxan-induced diabetic guineapigs were given whole seed diet 
of Phaseolus mungo (black gram) for 4 wk, the blood glucose, serum total lipids, 
triglycerides and esterified fraction of cholesterol were significantly lowered, 
while serum phospholipid was unaltered. Total cholesterol/phospholipid ratio 
also decreased in normal as well as diabetic animals indicating the 
antiatherogenic nature of P. mungo.
