Sixty-seven diabetic patients and 12 normal subjects were selected for a 
clinical study with an indigenous herbal product. The study consisted of 2 
phases. In phase 1 study out of 25 diabetics (both insulin dependent and 
non-insulin dependent) only those in the age group of 41-50 years ie, 11 cases 
showed lowering of mean high blood sugar level in all samples from 1/2 an-hour 
to 2 hours with the test drug containing guar gum, methi, tundika and mesha 
shringi. But in phase 2 study there was lowering of blood sugar level with the 
test drug and with 2 of its constituents ie, guar gum and methi when used 
separately in 42 non-insulin dependent diabetics. While there was some blood 
sugar level lowering effect with guar gum and methi when used separately in 12 
normal subjects in phase 2 study, but that was not the same observed with the 
test drug. The results of this study indicate the efficacy of the product as an 
adjuvant.
