Réunion Island (Indian Ocean) has been suffering from its first known 
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemic since February 2005. To achieve a better 
understanding of the disease, a questionnaire was drawn up for hospital staff 
members and their household. CHIKV infected about one-third of the studied 
population, the proportion increasing with age and being higher in women. 
Presence of a garden was associated with CHIKV infection. The geographical 
distribution of cases was concordant with insect vector Aedes albopictus 
distribution. The main clinical signs were arthralgia and fever. The disease 
evolved towards full recovery in 34.4% of cases, a relapse in 55.6%, or a 
chronic form in 10%. Paracetamol was used as a painkiller in 95% of cases, 
sometimes associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticoids, or 
traditional herbal medicine. The survey provided valuable information on the 
factors that favour transmission, the clinical signs, the importance of relapses 
and the therapies used.
