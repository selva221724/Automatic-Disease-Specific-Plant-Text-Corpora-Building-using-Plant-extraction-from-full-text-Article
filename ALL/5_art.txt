Gymnema sylvestre R. Br. is one of the most important medicinal plants that 
grows in tropical forests in India and South East Asia. Its active ingredients 
and extracts of leaves and roots are used in traditional medicine to treat 
various ailments and they are present in the market for pharmaceutical and 
parapharmaceutical products. Commercial products based on substances of plant 
origin that are generally connoted as natural have to be subjected to monitoring 
and evaluation by health authorities for their potential impacts on public 
health. The monitoring and evaluation of these products are critical because the 
boundary between a therapeutic action and a functional or healthy activity has 
not yet been defined in a clear and unambiguous way. Therefore, these products 
are considered borderline products, and they require careful and rigorous 
studies, in order to use them as complement and/or even replacement of synthetic 
drugs that are characterized by side effects and high economic costs. This 
review explores the traditional uses, chemical composition and biological 
activity of G. sylvestre extracts, providing a general framework on the most 
interesting extracts and what are the necessary studies for a complete 
definition of the range of activities.
