Plants traditionally used in India to treat fever or malaria were examined in 
vitro for antiplasmodial properties against Plasmodium falciparum. Of 80 
analysed ethanol extracts, from 47 species, significant effects were found for 
31 of the extracts. These represent 23 different species from 20 families. Of 
the active species 20 were tested against P. falciparum for the first time. The 
following five species seems to be of special interest for further antimalarial 
studies, Casearia elliptica, Holarrhena pubescens, Pongamia pinnata, Soymida 
febrifuga, and Plumbago zeylanica.
