Seventeen Cree antidiabetic medicinal plants were studied to determine their 
potential to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) through mechanism-based 
inactivation (MBI). The ethanolic extracts of the medicinal plants were studied 
for their inhibition of CYP3A4 using the substrates testosterone and 
dibenzylfluorescein (DBF) in high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 
microtiter fluorometric assays, respectively. Using testosterone as a substrate, 
extracts of Alnus incana, Sarracenia purpurea, and Lycopodium clavatum were 
identified as potent CYP3A4 MBIs, while those from Abies balsamea, Picea 
mariana, Pinus banksiana, Rhododendron tomentosum, Kalmia angustifolia, and 
Picea glauca were identified as less potent inactivators. Not unexpectedly, the 
other substrate, DBF, showed a different profile of inhibition. Only A. balsamea 
was identified as a CYP3A4 MBI using DBF. Abies balsamea displayed both NADPH- 
and time-dependence of CYP3A4 inhibition using both substrates. Overall, several 
of the medicinal plants may markedly deplete CYP3A4 through MBI and, 
consequently, decrease the metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates including numerous 
medications used by diabetics.
