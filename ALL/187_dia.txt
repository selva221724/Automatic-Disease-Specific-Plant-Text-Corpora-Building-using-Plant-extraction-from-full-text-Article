The influence of opuntia robusta (prickly pear), a traditionally used dietary 
nutrient against diabetes mellitus among the American Indian population, was 
examined in 15 young patients suffering from familial heterozygous isolated 
hypercholesterolemia. Oxidation injury was determined via 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha)in 
plasma, serum and urine. Daily consumption of 250 g broiled edible pulp of 
prickly pear had no influence on body weight and body fat composition. Total 
cholesterol was lowered (P<0.01) as was LDL-cholesterol (P<0.04). No significant 
changes were observed either in triglycerides or in HDL. Prickly pear induced a 
significant decrease in plasma (27.9+/-3.3-->25.6+/-3.2;P<0.03), serum 
(302.0+/-11.4-->283.2+/-14.5;P<0.0003) and urinary 
(355.9+/-18.4-->323.9+/-16;P<0.00002) 8-epi-PGF(2alpha)values. The findings on a 
decrease of 8-epi-PGF(2alpha)were more pronounced in females than in males, the 
highest significance being found in urine, while, in contrast, the effects on 
total- and LDL-cholesterol were more pronounced in males. A prerunning 4 weeks 
period of dietary counseling had no significant effect on either of the 
parameters examined. These findings indicate that the regular ingestion of 
opuntia robusta is able to significantly reduce in-vivo oxidation injury in a 
group of patients suffering from familial hypercholesterolemia. This traditional 
food of the American Indians thus may have a significant cardiovascular benefit.
