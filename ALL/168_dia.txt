Prickly pear is traditionally used by Pima Indians as a dietary nutrient against 
diabetes mellitus. We examined the effect of daily consumption of 250 g in 8 
healthy volunteers and 8 patients with mild familial heterozygous 
hypercholesterolemia on various parameters of platelet function. Beside its 
action on lipids and lipoproteins, prickly pear consumption significantly 
reduced the platelet proteins (platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin), 
ADP-induced platelet aggregation and improved platelet sensitivity (against PGI2 
and PGE1) in volunteers as well as in patients. Also plasma 11-DH-TXB2 and the 
WU-test showed a significant improvement in both patients and volunteers. In 
contrast, collagen-induced platelet aggregation and the number of circulating 
endothelial cells showed a significant response in patients only. No influence 
of prickly pear ingestion on peripheral platelet count was monitored. The 
dietary run-in period did not influence any of the parameters of haemostasis 
examined. No sex difference was seen. Prickly pear may induce at least part of 
its beneficial actions on the cardiovascular system via decreasing platelet 
activity and thereby improving haemostatic balance.
