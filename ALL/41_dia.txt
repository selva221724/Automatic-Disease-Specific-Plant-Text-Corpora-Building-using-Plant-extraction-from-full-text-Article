Thirty-five plant species were selected from the published literature as 
traditionally used by the Indigenous Peoples of the boreal forest in Canada for 
three or more symptoms of diabetes or its complications. Antioxidant activities 
in methanolic extracts support the contribution of these traditional medicines 
in a lifestyle historically low in the incidence of diabetes. In a DPPH assay of 
free radical scavenging activity 89% of the methanol extracts had activity 
significantly greater than common modern dietary components, 14% were 
statistically equal to ascorbic acid and 23% had activities similar to green tea 
and a Trolox positive control. Superoxides produced with an NBT/xanthine oxidase 
assay found scavenging was significantly higher in 29% of the species as 
compared with the modern dietary components and Trolox. The methanol extracts of 
Rhus hirta, Quercus alba and Cornus stolonifera performed similarly to green 
tea's in this assay. Assessment of peroxyl radical scavenging using a DCF/AAPH 
assay showed 60% of the plant extracts statistically similar to Trolox while R. 
hirta and Solidago canadensis extracts were greater than green tea, ascorbic 
acid and Trolox. The majority of the species (63 and 97%, respectively) had 
scavenging activities similar to ascorbic acid in the superoxide and peroxyl 
radical scavenging assays.
