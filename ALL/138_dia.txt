Powdered leaves (500 mg/kg body weight) of medicinal plants M. indica and C. 
igneus known to possess therapeutic effect were supplemented to streptozotocin 
induced diabetic rats. Leaf powders of both the plants were able to reduce blood 
glucose levels in the animals by 38 and 21% respectively after 15 days of 
supplementation. The preliminary results suggest that both the plants possess 
potent hypoglycemic activity.
