The genus Tinospora includes 34 species, in which several herbs were used as 
traditional medicines by indigenous groups throughout the tropical and 
subtropical parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia. The extensive literature 
survey revealed Tinospora species to be a group of important medicinal plants 
used for the ethnomedical treatment of colds, headaches, pharyngitis, fever, 
diarrhea, oral ulcer, diabetes, digestive disorder, and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Indian ethnopharmacological data points to the therapeutic potential of the T. 
cordifolia for the treatment of diabetic conditions. While Tinospora species are 
confusing in individual ingredients and their mechanisms of action, the 
ethnopharmacological history of those plants indicated that they exhibit 
antidiabetic, antioxidation, antitumor, anti-inflammation, antimicrobial, 
antiosteoporosis, and immunostimulation activities. While the clinical 
applications in modern medicine are lacking convincing evidence and support, 
this review is aimed at summarizing the current knowledge of the traditional 
uses, phytochemistry, biological activities, and toxicities of the genus 
Tinospora to reveal its therapeutic potentials and gaps, offering opportunities 
for future researches.
