Gymnema sylvestre R. Br., one of the most important medicinal plants of the 
Asclepiadaceae family, is a herb distributed throughout the World, predominantly 
in tropical countries. The plant, widely used for the treatment of diabetes and 
as a diuretic in Indian proprietary medicines, possesses beneficial digestive, 
anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and anti-helmentic effects. Furthermore, it is 
believed to be useful in the treatment of dyspepsia, constipation, jaundice, 
hemorrhoids, cardiopathy, asthma, bronchitis and leucoderma. A literature survey 
revealed that some other notable pharmacological activities of the plant such as 
anti-obesity, hypolipidemic, antimicrobial, free radical scavenging and 
anti-inflammatory properties have been proven too. This paper aims to summarize 
the chemical and pharmacological reports on a large group of C-4 
gem-dimethylated pentacyclic triterpenoids from Gymnema sylvestre.
