The polyol enzyme aldose reductase (AR) and advanced glycation endproducts 
(AGEs) play an important role in diabetic complications such as cataracts. The 
purpose of this study was to investigate four standardized plant extracts used 
for the treatment of diabetes and related diseases, and their principal 
components for AR inhibitory activity and to find out their influence in 
diabetic complications. Thus, Boswellia serrata Triana & Planch. (Burseraceae), 
Lagerstroemia speciosa (L.) Pers. (Lythraceae), Ocimum gratissimum (L.) 
(Lamiaceae) and Syzygium cumin (L.) Skeels. (Myrthaceae) and their respective 
major constituents, boswellic acid, corosolic acid, ursolic acid and ellagic 
acid, were studied for their inhibitory activity against rat lens AR, rat kidney 
AR, human recombinant AR and generation of AGEs. In addition, in vivo inhibition 
of lens galactitol accumulation by the major constituents of the plants in 
galactose-fed rat has been studied. The results revealed that all the tested 
extracts and their active ingredients possess significant AR inhibitory actions 
in both in vitro and in vivo assays with urosolic acid showing the most potent 
effect. Furthermore, the study indicates the potential of the studied plants and 
their major constituents as possible protective agents against long-term 
diabetic complications.
