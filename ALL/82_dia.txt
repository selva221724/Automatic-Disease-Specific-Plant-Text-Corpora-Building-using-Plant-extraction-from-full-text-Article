Free radicals scavenging and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) inhibitory 
potentials in crude chloroform extract of Schisandra grandiflora were evaluated. 
Bioassay-guided isolation of the chloroform extract led to the identification of 
24 compounds. Among the isolates, ( ± ) gomisin M1, arisantetralone C and D, 
macelignan, saurulignan B and SZ-MO displayed potent-free radical scavenging as 
well as AGEs inhibitory potentials. This is the first report identifying the 
presence of AGEs inhibitory activity and assigning AGEs inhibitory activity to 
these compounds. Therefore, our research finds new application of traditional 
medicinal plant S. grandiflora having capacity to reduce formation and 
accumulation of AGEs in diabetes.
