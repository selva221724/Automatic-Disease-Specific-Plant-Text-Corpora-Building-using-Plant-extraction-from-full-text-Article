Hypoglycaemic effect of a Neapalese plant Biophytum sensitivum was investigated 
in the alloxan diabetic male rabbits of different severities: subdiabetic 
(Alloxan recovered; AR), mild diabetic (MD) and severely diabetic (SD). 
Assessment of activity of the extract, prepared from the plant leaves, was done 
by fall in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and improvement in the oral glucose 
tolerance test (OGTT), following single dose and prolonged administrations. 
Following single dose administration there was fall in 1 hour and 2.5 hour 
glucose values by 25.9% and 27.4% respectively in the subdiabetic rabbits, and 
by 36.9% and 37.7% in the mild diabetic rabbits. Improved GTT response is shown 
by fall in area under curve (AUC) from 16138 mg/dl to 12355 mg/dl (23.4%) in the 
subdiabetic rabbits, and from 19258 to 12238 mg/dl in the MD rabbits. More 
significant improvements occurred following one week of above treatment. The 
results prove that the plant material has significant hypoglycaemic effect, 
which is possibly due to pancreatic beta-cell stimulating action. To investigate 
its possible role in correction of other metabolic abnormalities of diabetes 
further long term studies are required.
