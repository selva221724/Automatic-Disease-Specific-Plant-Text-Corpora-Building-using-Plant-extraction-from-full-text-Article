Diuretic, hypotensive and hypoglycaemic effects of Phyllanthus amarus (syn. 
Phyllanthus niruri) on human subjects were assessed. Nine mild hypertensives 
(four of them also suffering from diabetes mellitus) were treated with a 
preparation of the whole plant of P. amarus for 10 days. Suitable parameters 
were studied in the blood and urine samples of the subjects, along with 
physiological profile and dietary pattern before and after the treatment period. 
Significant increase in 24 hr urine volume, urine and serum Na levels was 
observed. A significant reduction in systolic blood pressure in non-diabetic 
hypertensives and female subjects was noted. Blood glucose was also 
significantly reduced in the treated group. Clinical observations revealed no 
harmful side effects. These observations indicate that P. amarus is a potential 
diuretic, hypotensive and hypoglycaemic drug for humans.
