Protective effect was evaluated in streptozoticin (STZ)-induced diabetes rats. 
2-Hydroxy 4-methoxy benzoic acid (HMBA) was isolated from the roots of 
Hemidesmus indicus and administered (500 microg/kg body weight) orally for 7 
weeks to STZ-induced diabetic and non-diabetic rats to study its effect on 
protein metabolism, serum electrolytes and on liver and kidney lipid peroxides. 
Oral administration of HMBA restored the altered biochemical parameters such as 
urea, uric acid, creatinine, plasma proteins and serum electrolytes to 
near-normal levels. HMBA treatment significantly decreased lipid peroxidation 
and malondialdehyde levels in diabetic liver and kidney. Effect of HMBA was 
equivalent to that of the standard drug, tolbutamide (100 mg/kg body wt). The 
histological changes were also in correlation with the biochemical findings. The 
present study showed that HMBA isolated from H. indicus roots had ameliorative 
effect on liver, kidney and pancreatic injury in STZ-induced diabetic rats.
