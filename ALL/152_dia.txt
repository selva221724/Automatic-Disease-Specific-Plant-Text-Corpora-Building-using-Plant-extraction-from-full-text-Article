The functional basis of diabetes-mellitus to a certain extent, can be elucidated 
by studying diabetes-induced changes in metabolic enzymes. Malate dehydrogenase 
(MDH), is an enzyme directly involved in glucose metabolism. The kinetic 
parameters of MDH and its purified cytosolic isozyme, S-MDH, have been studied 
in the liver of streptozotocin-diabetic rats; also the potential of the leaf 
extract of A. marmelose as an anti-diabetic agent was investigated. The Km of 
the liver enzyme increased significantly, in both crude and purified 
preparations in the diabetic state when compared to the respective controls. 
Insulin as well as leaf-extract treatment of the diabetic rats brought about a 
reversal of Km values to near normal. Vmax of purified S-MDH was significantly 
higher in the diabetic state when compared to the control. Insulin and leaf 
extract treatment did not reverse this change. Since MDH is an important enzyme 
in glucose metabolism, the variation in its quantitative and qualitative nature 
may contribute to the pathological status of diabetes. The fact that leaf 
extract of A. marmelose was found to be as effective as insulin in restoration 
of blood glucose and body weight to normal levels, the use of A. marmelose as 
potential hypoglycemic agent is suggested.
