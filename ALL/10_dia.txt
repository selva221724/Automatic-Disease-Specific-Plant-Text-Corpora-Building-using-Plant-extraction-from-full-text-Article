The demand for interdisciplinary research is increasing in the new millennium to 
help us understand complex problems and find solutions by integrating the 
knowledge from different disciplines. The present review is an excellent example 
of this and shows how unique combination of physics, chemistry, and biological 
techniques can be used for the evaluation of Indian medicinal herbs used for 
treating diabetes mellitus. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a 
sensitive optical technique that is widely used for its simplicity and 
versatility. This review presents the most recent application of LIBS for 
detection of glycemic elements in medicinal plants. The characteristics of 
matrices, object analysis, use of laser system, and analytical performances with 
respect to Indian herbs are discussed.
