In our experiments 30 hypoglycaemic medicinal plants (known and less known) have 
been selected for thorough studies from indigenous folk medicines, Ayurvedic, 
Unani and Siddha systems of medicines. In all the experiments with different 
herbal samples (vacuum dried 95% ethanolic extracts), definite blood glucose 
lowering effect within 2 weeks have been confirmed in alloxan diabetic albino 
rats. Blood glucose values are brought down close to normal fasting level using 
herbal samples at a dose of 250 mg/kg once, twice or thrice daily, as needed. 
While evaluating comparative hypoglycaemic activity of the experimental herbal 
samples, significant blood glucose lowering activities are observed in 
decreasing order in the following 24 samples-Coccinia indica, Tragia 
involucrata, G. sylvestre, Pterocarpus marsupium, T. foenum-graecum, Moringa 
oleifera, Eugenia jambolana, Tinospora cordifolia, Swertia chirayita, Momordica 
charantia, Ficus glomerata, Ficus benghalensis, Vinca rosea, Premna 
integrifolia, Mucuna prurita, Terminalia bellirica, Sesbenia aegyptiaca, 
Azadirachta indica, Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, Zingiber officinale, Aegle 
marmelos, Cinnamomum tamala, Trichosanthes cucumerina and Ocimum sanctum. 
Present studies besides confirming hypoglycaemic activities of the experimental 
herbal samples, help identify more potent indigenous hypoglycaemic herbs (in 
crude ethanolic extract) from the comparative study of the reported experimental 
results.
