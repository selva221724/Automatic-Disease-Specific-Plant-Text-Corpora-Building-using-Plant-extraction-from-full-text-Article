Curcumin is a substance obtained from the root of the turmeric plant, which has 
the feature of being a yellow or orange pigment. It is also the main component 
of curry powder commonly used in Asian cuisine. Curcumin, a substance that has 
had an important place in traditional Indian and Chinese medicines for thousands 
of years, has been the center of interest for scientific studies especially in 
the field of cancer treatment for several years. Laboratory studies have 
presented some favorable results in terms of curcumin's antioxidant, 
antiinflammatory and anticancer properties in particular. However, since such 
findings have yet to be confirmed in clinical studies, its effect on humans is 
not clearly known. Therefore, when its advantages in terms of toxicity, cost and 
availability as well as the favorable results achieved in laboratory studies are 
considered, it would not be wrong to say that curcumin is a substance worth 
being studied. However, for now the most correct approach is to abstain from its 
use for medical purposes due to lack of adequate reliable evidence obtained from 
clinical studies, and because of its potential to interfere with other drugs.

Cancer is a major public health problem and the second leading cause of 
mortality around the world. Although continuous advances in the science of 
oncology and cancer research are now leading to improved outcomes for many 
cancer patients, novel cancer treatment options are strongly demanded. Naturally 
occurring compounds from a variety of vegetables, fruits, and medicinal plants 
have been shown to exhibit various anticancer properties in a number of in vitro 
and in vivo studies and represent an attractive research area for the 
development of new therapeutic strategies to fight cancer. Forskolin is a 
diterpene produced by the roots of the Indian plant Coleus forskohlii. The 
natural compound forskolin has been used for centuries in traditional medicine 
and its safety has also been documented in conventional modern medicine. 
Forskolin directly activates the adenylate cyclase enzyme, that generates cAMP 
from ATP, thus, raising intracellular cAMP levels. Notably, cAMP signaling, 
through the PKA-dependent and/or -independent pathways, is very relevant to 
cancer and its targeting has shown a number of antitumor effects, including the 
induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, inhibition of cell growth and 
migration and enhancement of sensitivity to conventional antitumor drugs in 
cancer cells. Here, we describe some features of cAMP signaling that are 
relevant to cancer biology and address the state of the art concerning the 
natural cAMP elevating compound forskolin and its perspectives as an effective 
anticancer agent. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 922-927, 2017. © 2016 Wiley

Withania somnifera, also called 'Indian ginseng', is an important medicinal 
plant of the Indian subcontinent. It is widely used, singly or in combination, 
with other herbs against many ailments in Indian Systems of Medicine since time 
immemorial. Withania somnifera contains a spectrum of diverse phytochemicals 
enabling it to have a broad range of biological implications. In preclinical 
studies, it has shown anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, 
anti-stress, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-diabetic properties. 
Additionally, it has demonstrated the ability to reduce reactive oxygen species, 
modulate mitochondrial function, regulate apoptosis, and reduce inflammation and 
enhance endothelial function. In view of these pharmacologic properties, W. 
somnifera is a potential drug candidate to treat various clinical conditions, 
particularly related to the nervous system. In this review, we summarize the 
pharmacologic characteristics and discuss the mechanisms of action and potential 
therapeutic applications of the plant and its active constituents.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Zeliangrong people with their yearlong 
experiences still depend on the medicinal plants for primary healthcare. Some of 
the medicinal plants used by the community exhibits established pharmacological 
activities which signify the importance of the traditional knowledge of the 
tribes. Besides, many other species traditionally used by the tribes assume to 
have pharmacological potentiality.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aimed to identify the medicinally and 
pharmacologically important species with understanding the traditional healing 
practices and to compare medicinal plant knowledge among the informants of the 
three tribes under Zeliangrong group.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected by interviewing selected 27 herbal 
healers using modified semi-structured questionnaires. Identification and 
documentation of all the species have been made using standard taxonomic 
procedure. Ethnomedicinal uses of all the recorded species was analyzed with 
computation of the use reports for each species and Informant Consensus Factor.
RESULTS: The study recorded 145 medicinal plants used in healing practices by 
the Zeliangrong tribes. Except 2 species, all are Angiospermic plants found 
mostly in wild condition. These medicinal plants are used for treating about 59 
different health ailments categorized under 13 ICPC disease categories. Highest 
ICF (0.75) was found in Digestive disorder with 174 use reports for 44 plant 
species. Besides the established medicinal plants in the Indian System of 
medicine like Acorus calamus, Centella asiatica, Oroxylum indicum and 
Phyllanthus emblica, a number of other species like Ageratum conizoides, 
Blumeopsis flava, Clerodendrum glandulosum, Gynura cusimbua, Hedyotis scandens 
and Paederia foetida also has maximum use reports. Among the species with higher 
use reports, 2 species namely Clerodendrum glandulosum and Paederia foetida are 
exclusively used for the treatment of hypertension, and bone fracture and sprain 
respectively indicating their remarkable medicinal values and acceptability. Out 
of the total 145 species, only 24 are shared by all the three tribes with 11 
species used for similar diseases.
CONCLUSION: The medicinal plants with higher use reports can be evaluated for 
validation of pharmacological activities and their toxicity. The Indigenous 
Knowledge System of Zeliangrong community for herbal remedies may be of immense 
value in pharmacological experimentation particularly for the uses like malaria, 
health tonic, cancer, jaundice, hypertension and diabetes.

Medicinal plants, having great elementary and therapeutic importance, are the 
gift to mankind to acquire healthy lifestyle. Emblica officinalis Gaertn. or 
Phyllanthus emblica Linn. (Euphorbeaceae), commonly known as Indian gooseberry 
or Amla, has superior value in entirely indigenous traditional system of 
medicine, including folklore Ayurveda, for medicinal and nutritional purposes to 
build up lost vitality and vigor. In this article, numerous phytochemicals 
isolated from E. officinalis and its ethnomedical and pharmacological potentials 
with molecular mechanisms are briefly deliberated and recapitulated. The 
information documented in the present review was collected from more than 270 
articles, published or accepted in the last five to six decades, and more than 
20 e-books using various online database. Additional information was obtained 
from various botanical books and dissertations. The extracts from various parts 
of E. officinalis, especially fruit, contain numerous phytoconstituents viz. 
higher amount of polyphenols like gallic acid, ellagic acid, different tannins, 
minerals, vitamins, amino acids, fixed oils, and flavonoids like rutin and 
quercetin. The extract or plant is identified to be efficacious against 
diversified ailments like inflammation, cancer, osteoporosis, neurological 
disorders, hypertension together with lifestyle diseases, parasitic and other 
infectious disorders. These actions are attributed to either regulation of 
various molecular pathway involved in several pathophysiologies or antioxidant 
property which prevents the damage of cellular compartments from oxidative 
stress. However, serious efforts are required in systemic research to identify, 
isolate and evaluate the chemical constituents for nutritional and therapeutic 
potentials.

Ayurveda based nanomaterials are recently conceptualized phenomena for 
biomedical applications especially for imaging and treatment of in vitro cancer 
cell. Wide range florescent (blue to red emission) quantum dots are versatile 
materials for imaging and sensing applications. Various procedures and 
precursors of fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are well established and 
documented in the literature. However, expensive precursors and production, and 
time consuming process limit their economical design that need to be addressed. 
Herein, we report a cost effective simple route for fluorescent CQDs by using 
affordable ayurvedic plant's precursors such as Azadirachta Indica, 
OcimumTenuiflorum and Tridax Procumbens. Obtained quantum dots from ayurvedic 
plant leaves namely CQDs-1 (AzadirachtaIndica), CQDs-2 (OcimumTenuiflorum) and 
CQDs-3 (TridaxProcumbens) showed homogeneous size distribution (∼6-12 nm) and 
green fluorescent nature, average photo-stability, biocompatibility (more than 
85 %), cancer cell imaging and promising phototherapy for cancer and bacterial 
cell lines.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant and 
antiproliferative activities of 10 traditional medicinal plants, Asclepias 
curassavica, Ophiorrhiza mungos Linn., Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers, Costus 
speciosus (J. Koenig.) Smith Costaceae, Achyranthes aspera L., Amaranthus 
tristis Roxb., Blepharis maderaspatensis L., Merremia emerginata Hall.f., Aegle 
marmelos Corr., and Tabernaemontana heyneana Wall., used in the traditional 
Indian system of medicine as a cure for cancer. The present study focuses on the 
anticancer potential of traditional medicinal plants to induce apoptosis in 
cancer cell lines.
METHODS: Plants were sequentially extracted with hexane, ethyl acetate, and 
methanol. The extract was concentrated to yield the crude extract, which was 
tested for antioxidant activity using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, nitric 
oxide and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assays 
on four cancer cell lines and a normal cell line. The anticancer potential of 
cytotoxic extracts was determined by the Annexin-fluorescein 
isothiocyanate-conjugated assay in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (COLO 
320 DM).
RESULTS: All the tested extracts showed significant antioxidant and 
antiproliferative activities in a concentration- and time-dependant manner in 
the following descending order: A. curassavica > C. dactylon > C. speciosus root 
> A. tristis > M. emarginata > O. mungos > T. Heyneana > B. maderaspatensis > A. 
marmelos > A. aspera.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study support the need of further studies 
to isolate potential anticancer drug with cancer cell-specific cytotoxicity. 
Additionally, the study supports the anticancer property of medicinal plants 
used in the traditional Indian medicine system and further evaluation of the 
selected medicinal plants for an effective anticancer drug with minimal side 
effects.

Emblica officinalis Gaertn. or Phyllanthus emblica Linn, commonly known as 
Indian gooseberry or amla, is arguably the most important medicinal plant in the 
Indian traditional system of medicine, the Ayurveda. Various parts of the plant 
are used to treat a range of diseases, but the most important is the fruit. The 
fruit is used either alone or in combination with other plants to treat many 
ailments such as common cold and fever; as a diuretic, laxative, liver tonic, 
refrigerant, stomachic, restorative, alterative, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, 
hair tonic; to prevent peptic ulcer and dyspepsia, and as a digestive. 
Preclinical studies have shown that amla possesses antipyretic, analgesic, 
antitussive, antiatherogenic, adaptogenic, cardioprotective, gastroprotective, 
antianemia, antihypercholesterolemia, wound healing, antidiarrheal, 
antiatherosclerotic, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, and neuroprotective 
properties. In addition, experimental studies have shown that amla and some of 
its phytochemicals such as gallic acid, ellagic acid, pyrogallol, some 
norsesquiterpenoids, corilagin, geraniin, elaeocarpusin, and prodelphinidins B1 
and B2 also possess antineoplastic effects. Amla is also reported to possess 
radiomodulatory, chemomodulatory, chemopreventive effects, free radical 
scavenging, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic and immunomodulatory 
activities, properties that are efficacious in the treatment and prevention of 
cancer. This review for the first time summarizes the results related to these 
properties and also emphasizes the aspects that warrant future research to 
establish its activity and utility as a cancer preventive and therapeutic drug 
in humans.

Aegle marmelos Linn. (Rutaceae), commonly known as "bael" in Nepal and India, is 
a valuable medicinal plant and is considered sacred by the Hindus. It is used to 
cure several diseases in the Indian traditional medicine system of Ayurveda and 
has had similar uses among many ethnic communities residing in Indian 
subcontinent for over 5000 years. Its leaves, bark, stem, fruits and seeds have 
been used for various medicinal purposes. Bael fruits are especially effective 
in the treatment of chronic diarrhea, dysentery and peptic ulcers, while they 
are also useful as a laxative and cure for respiratory infections. Scientific 
studies have validated many of the ethnomedicinal uses of A. marmelos, which 
include antibacterial, antiviral, antidiarrheal, gastroprotective, 
anti-ulcerative colitis, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, cardioprotective and 
radioprotective effects. Recently, this plant has also received attention as an 
anticancer agent for the treatment of various types of cancers. Thus, this 
review focuses on scientific evidence verifying the important pharmacological 
activity such as antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, 
cardioprotective and anticancer activity of A. marmelos.

Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) is a perennial succulent medicinal plant. It 
has been used as a traditional or folk medicine for thousands of years and 
claimed that it possesses wound and burn healing activities, and 
anti-inflammatory as well as immunomodulatory effects. In recent years, the use 
of Aloe vera has been growing as a dietary supplement. The pre-clinical studies 
over the last couple of decades uncover the potential therapeutic activities of 
Aloe vera and its bioactive compounds, especially against neoplastic disease. 
Such investigations indicate the possible preventive as well as therapeutic 
effects of Aloe vera against cancer. Here, we discuss the crucial bioactive 
compounds of Aloe vera that have been harnessed against cancer and also address 
several mechanisms of action of these lead bioactive compounds compared to other 
standard drugs involved in cancer prevention and treatment.

Turmeric, derived from the plant Curcuma longa, is a gold-colored spice commonly 
used in the Indian subcontinent, not only for health care but also for the 
preservation of food and as a yellow dye for textiles. Curcumin, which gives the 
yellow color to turmeric, was first isolated almost two centuries ago, and its 
structure as diferuloylmethane was determined in 1910. Since the time of 
Ayurveda (1900 Bc) numerous therapeutic activities have been assigned to 
turmeric for a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including those of the 
skin, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems, aches, pains, wounds, sprains, 
and liver disorders. Extensive research within the last half century has proven 
that most of these activities, once associated with turmeric, are due to 
curcumin. Curcumin has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities and thus has a 
potential against various malignant diseases, diabetes, allergies, arthritis, 
Alzheimer's disease, and other chronic illnesses. These effects are mediated 
through the regulation of various transcription factors, growth factors, 
inflammatory cytokines, protein kinases, and other enzymes. Curcumin exhibits 
activities similar to recently discovered tumor necrosis factor blockers (e.g., 
HUMIRA, REMICADE, and ENBREL), a vascular endothelial cell growth factor blocker 
(e.g., AVASTIN), human epidermal growth factor receptor blockers (e.g., ERBITUX, 
ERLOTINIB, and GEFTINIB), and a HER2 blocker (e.g., HERCEPTIN). Considering the 
recent scientific bandwagon that multitargeted therapy is better than 
monotargeted therapy for most diseases, curcumin can be considered an ideal 
"Spice for Life".

Several modern treatment strategies have been adopted to combat cancer with the 
aim of minimizing toxicity. Medicinal plant-based compounds with the potential 
to treat cancer have been widely studied in preclinical research and have 
elicited many innovations in cutting-edge clinical research. In parallel, 
researchers have eagerly tried to decrease the toxicity of current 
chemotherapeutic agents either by combining them with herbals or in using 
herbals alone. The aim of this article is to present an update of medicinal 
plants and their bioactive compounds, or mere changes in the bioactive 
compounds, along with herbal edibles, which display efficacy against diverse 
cancer cells and in anticancer therapy. It describes the basic mechanism(s) of 
action of phytochemicals used either alone or in combination therapy with other 
phytochemicals or herbal edibles. This review also highlights the remarkable 
synergistic effects that arise between certain herbals and chemotherapeutic 
agents used in oncology. The anticancer phytochemicals used in clinical research 
are also described; furthermore, we discuss our own experience related to 
semisynthetic derivatives, which are developed based on phytochemicals. Overall, 
this compilation is intended to facilitate research and development projects on 
phytopharmaceuticals for successful anticancer drug discovery.

BACKGROUND: Plants have been known as an integral part of traditional medicine 
because of their phytoconstituents with their miraculous substances. Tinospora 
cordifolia (Guduchi/ Giloy) is one such plant having pharmacological functions 
and medicinal values due to its several constituents such as terpenes, 
glycosides, alkaloids, steroids and flavonoids. Thus, it has been rightly 
mentioned in old texts as "Amrita".
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present review is to extend the current 
knowledge, importance and beneficial pharmacological applications of guduchi in 
humans for safeguarding various health issues.
METHODS: We extensively reviewed, analyzed and compiled salient information from 
the published literature available in PubMed and other scientific databases.
RESULTS: The present review describes medicinal applications of T. cordifolia in 
countering various disorders and usages as anti-oxidant, anti-hyperglycemic, 
antihyperlipidemic, hepatoprotective, cardiovascular protective, 
neuroprotective, osteoprotective, radioprotective, anti-anxiety, adaptogenic 
agent, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, a thrombolytic agent, 
anti-diarrheal, anti-ulcer, anti-microbial and anti-cancer agent. The plant is 
also a source of micronutrients viz. copper, calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc and 
manganese. A special focus has been made on its health benefits in treating 
endocrine and metabolic disorders and its potential as an immune booster. 
Several patents have been filed and granted to inventions encompassing T. 
cordifolia as a major component of therapeutics for ameliorating metabolic, 
endocrinal and several other ailments, aiding in the betterment of human life

Many plants are found to possess reliable pharmacological properties and have 
started to attract the attention of researchers. One such holistic plant is 
Acorus calamus, commonly known as sweet flag, belonging to the rhizomatous 
family Acoraceae. The different parts of this plant, such as the leaves and 
rhizomes, are used traditionally in different medicinal preparations for the 
treatment of various ailments including arthritis, neuralgia, diarrhoea, 
dyspepsia, kidney and liver troubles, eczema, sinusitis, asthma, fevers, 
bronchitis, hair loss, and other disorders. Many reports have also appeared in 
mainstream scientific journals confirming its nutritional and medicinal 
properties. Biochemical analysis of the plant has revealed a large number of 
secondary metabolites that may be responsible for its rich medicinal properties. 
Basic scientific research has uncovered the mechanisms by which itexerts its 
therapeutic effects. Medicinal herbs such as A. calamus are quite promising in 
the recent therapeutic scenario, with a large number of people favouring 
remedies and health approaches that are free from the side effects often 
associated with synthetic chemicals. In this review, we try to summarise the 
ethno-medicinal uses, botanical descriptions, phytochemical constituents, and 
biological activity of the plant parts, as well as the molecular targets of A. 
calamus, which we hope will serve as a good base for further work on this plant.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional medicine of the Native Americans has 
a long tradition of medicinal plants, which also influenced modern oncology. For 
instance, podophyllotoxin the active ingredient of Podophyllum peltatum L. 
(Berberidaceae) used by Native Americans to treat warts led to the development 
of etoposide and teniposide. In the present investigation, we studied 10 
medicinal plants used by the Gwich׳in First Nation of West-Canada, which have 
been used against diverse diseases including cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cell lines 
expressing various ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters 
(P-glycoprotein/ABCB1/MDR1, MRP1/ABCC1, or BCRP/ABCG2) have been used. 
Cytotoxicity was determined by the resazurin assay.
RESULTS: Arctium minus Bernh. (Asteraceae). Lysichiton americanus Hultén & St. 
John (Araceae), and Maianthemum dilatatum (Alph.Wood) A.Nelson & 
J.F.Macbr.(Asparagaceae) were cytotoxic with IC50 values ranging from 2.40 to 
86.35 µg/mL. The MDR cell lines did not exert cross-resistance to these 
extracts.
CONCLUSION: As these medicinal plants of the West-Canadian Gwich׳in First Nation 
were not involved in classical drug resistance mechanisms and might therefore be 
valuable to bypass anticancer drug resistance in refractory tumors.

The phenolic content, antioxidant, antitumor, and enzyme inhibitory activities 
of commonly used medicinal herbs from a Unani system of medicine were 
investigated using four different extraction methods. Among the plants studied, 
the Hyssopus officinalis L, Origanum vulgare L, and Portulaca oleracea L. 
extracts showed the highest amount of total phenolics (64.40, 60.35, and 
58.81 mg GAE/g) and revealed significant antioxidant activities. The plants also 
showed a maximum cytotoxic activity as indicated by H. officinalis (82%), O. 
vulgare (75%), and P. oleracea (72%) showed more than 70% cytotoxicity for 
breast cancer cells, 82% of the cells were dead at the concentration of 
500 mg/mL. The plants H. officinalis, P. oleracea, O. vulgare, and Rubia 
cordifolia L. revealed more than 80% inhibition towards xanthine oxidase and 
comprising maximum 70% of inhibition for superoxide dismutase. From results we 
conclude that there is a strong correlation between phenolic content, 
antioxidant, and enzyme inhibitory activity among these plants, indicating 
phenolics are the major compounds for these biological activities. Furthermore, 
this study provides the basis for the therapeutic importance of studied plants 
as latent inhibitors of oxidative stress and antitumor cell proliferation which 
correlate with the ethnobotanical data contained in the Unani system of 
medicine.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC (MP) is an ancient 
Indian medicinal plant traditionally used to treat Parkinson's disease. L-Dopa 
(LD), precursor of dopamine is abundantly found in the seeds of MP. L-dopa is a 
natural inhibitor of prolactin (PRL) hormone which is required to maintain 
lactation in women but it's over production (hyperprolactinemia) plays critical 
role in advancement of breast cancer.
AIM OF THE STUDY: We aim to examine the pharmacological effect of LD and MP on 
this hyperprolactinemia associated breast cancer and related signaling for 
effective management of the disease. We also investigated chemo-sensitizing 
effect of MP on hyperprolactinemia-mediated cisplatin resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic seed extract of MP were prepared and analysed 
using HPLC. Effect of LD and MP on the cellular viability of breast cancer cells 
(T47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) were evaluated using MTT assay. 
Further, effect of LD and MP on colony forming potential, DNA damage, cell cycle 
distribution and apoptosis was determined using agar/agarose method, comet assay 
and annexin and PI method followed by FACS analysis. To reveal the molecular 
mechanism involved in the anti-cancer activity of MP, transcriptional and 
translational level analysis of the key proteins involved in the PRL-mediated 
signaling, was performed using RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The effect of 
MP extract on PRL-mediated signaling was validated using dopaminergic agonist 
bromocriptine. MP extract and cisplatin was given in different combination with 
appropriate controls to check their effect on chemo-resistivity of breast cancer 
cells.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that MP seed extract has the potential to 
inhibit cellular proliferation of PRL expressing T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer 
cells via induction of DNA damage, G1 phase of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis 
more effectively as compare to LD. Further, MP-mediated anti-cancerous effect 
was associated with the downregulation of PRL expression, further suppressing 
the JAK2/STAT5A/Cyclin D1 signaling pathway which has been validated using 
dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine. Cancer-related hyperprolactinemia confers 
cisplatin resistance, we observed that MP via PRL inhibition, enhances cisplatin 
efficacy after their combinatorial treatment in breast cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study suggests that MP could be recommended as 
dietary supplement along with the chemotherapeutic agents against breast cancer.

Ocimum sanctum L. or Ocimum tenuiflorum L, commonly known as the Holy Basil in 
English or Tulsi in the various Indian languages, is a important medicinal plant 
in the various traditional and folk systems of medicine in Southeast Asia. 
Scientific studies have shown it to possess antiinflammatory, analgesic, 
antipyretic, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, hypolipidemic, antistress, and 
immunomodulatory activities. Preclinical studies have also shown that Tulsi and 
some of its phytochemicals eugenol, rosmarinic acid, apigenin, myretenal, 
luteolin, β-sitosterol, and carnosic acid prevented chemical-induced skin, 
liver, oral, and lung cancers and to mediate these effects by increasing the 
antioxidant activity, altering the gene expressions, inducing apoptosis, and 
inhibiting angiogenesis and metastasis. The aqueous extract of Tulsi and its 
flavanoids, orintin, and vicenin are shown to protect mice against 
γ-radiation-induced sickness and mortality and to selectively protect the normal 
tissues against the tumoricidal effects of radiation. The other important 
phytochemicals like eugenol, rosmarinic acid, apigenin, and carnosic acid are 
also shown to prevent radiation-induced DNA damage. This review summarizes the 
results related to the chemopreventive and radioprotective properties of Tulsi 
and also emphasizes aspects that warrant future research to establish its 
activity and utility in cancer prevention and treatment.

The present work aimed to investigate the anticancer in vitro activity of two 
plants commonly used in traditional Indian medicine: Zingiber officinale Roscoe 
and Nerium oleander L. The extracts of these plants were tested in vitro on 
several human leukemic cell lines, K562, THP-1, MOLT-4 and Jurkat. Cell growth 
inhibition was observed for both plant extracts with 50% inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) values ranging between 1 and 28 μg/mL using SRB 
(sulphorodamine B) and MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl 
tetrazolium bromide] assays. Enhanced cell growth inhibition was observed when 
the extracts were combined with imatinib. Exposed cells showed cell cycle 
arrest, DNA damage and cytochrome c release, indicating that the mechanism of 
cytotoxicity could be via mitochondrial mediated apoptotic pathways. Combination 
of the extracts of these plants with standard cancer treatment may be a way of 
enhancing responses. Clinical studies in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia 
are planned at our center.

Plants of the genus Terminalia are amongst the most widely used plants for 
traditional medicinal purposes worldwide. Many species are used for their 
antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antiviral, antidiarrhoeal, analgesic, 
antimalarial, antioxidant, antiinflammatory and anticancer activities. Wound 
healing and cardiovascular effects have also been credited to some species. Many 
Terminalia species have multiple beneficial effects for multiple diseases and 
ailments. Indeed, the Indian species Terminalia chebula is known as the king of 
plants in Ayurveda due to its broad range of medicinal uses. However, apart from 
the reported ethnopharmacological uses of many Terminalia species, surprisingly 
few studies have rigorously examined this important genus for their medical 
properties/mechanisms and phytochemistry. This is likely due to the high tannin 
content common to many Terminalia species and the perception that these tannins 
may be responsible for much of their beneficial properties. As the complexities 
of tannins make them poor candidates for drug design, most interest in 
Terminalia species has been for their pharmacognostic and nutraceutical value 
and they have often been overlooked as potentials for drug discovery. However, 
recent reports have identified many other interesting phytochemicals and 
demonstrated that these may be responsible for several of the reported 
bioactivities of the Terminalia species used in traditional medicinal systems. 
The last decade has seen a large increase in the number of studies into the use 
of Terminalia species as therapeutic agents. Several species used in Ayurvedic 
medicine (Terminalia arjuna, Terminalia bellerica, Terminalia catappa, T. 
chebula) in particular have received much recent attention. Similarly, recent 
reports have also highlighted the medicinal potential of species from Africa, 
Australia and the Americas. The aim of this report is to summarise the recent 
research into the medicinal properties, phytochemistry and therapeutic 
mechanisms of Terminalia species and thus to highlight and direct future areas 
of research into the medicinal activities of this important genus.

Herbal medicine has a long background equal to history of humankind. Several 
plants have been used as remedies in ancient Persian, Egyptian, Chinese and 
Indian civilizations. The plant Ocimum sanctum Linn. (Tulsi) is one of these 
medicinal plants with a wide variety of applications in traditional medicine. In 
modern era, it has been shown to be effective against diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, cancers, bronchitis, and found to have anti-microbial properties. 
Several experimental studies have confirmed its anti-inflammatory properties and 
its role in modulation of both cellular and humeral immunity. Recently its 
efficacy against inflammatory response, hepatic injury and gastric ulcer has 
been elucidated in animal studies. In liver, essential oils and extracts of 
Ocimum sanctum could prevent oxidative stress by increasing glutathione 
peroxidae and catalase and were also effective in prevention of hepatic 
steatosis. In gastric epithelial tissue different derivatives of Ocimum sanctum 
had anti-ulcer and anti-secretory characteristics and could heal gastric 
ulceration. These beneficial properties of this medicinal plant can mainly 
originate from its major biochemically active constituents like eugenol, 
carvacrol, ursolic acid, β-caryophyllene and rosmarinic acid. Here in, we 
reviewed current literature about anti-inflammatory, gastric and 
hepatoprotective properties of Ocimum sanctum.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. The main modality to 
fight against cancer is surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and more 
recently targeted therapy, gene therapy and immunotherapy, which play important 
roles in treating cancer patients. In the last decades, chemotherapy has been 
well developed. Nonetheless, administration of the drug is not always 
successful, as limited drug dosage can reach the tumor cells.. In this context, 
the possibility to use an encapsulated anti-cancer drug may potentially solve 
the problem. Liposomal cytarabine is a formulation with pronounced effectiveness 
in lymphomatous meningitis and reduced cardiotoxicity if compared to liposomal 
anthracyclines. Thus, the future liposomal cytarabine use could be extended to 
other diseases given its reduction in cytotoxic side effects compared to the 
free formulation. This review summarizes the chemistry and biology of liposomal 
cytarabine, with exploration of its clinical implications.

New Delhi, India.

Indian soil germinates thousands of medicinal drugs that are cultivated with a 
purpose to obtain a novel drug. As it is a well-established fact that the 
structural analogs with greater pharmacological activity and fewer side-effects 
may be generated by the molecular modification of the functional groups of such 
lead compounds. This review throws light on two natural triterpenes - Taraxerol 
and Taraxasterol which have many important pharmacological actions including 
anti-cancer activity, their chemistry, biosynthesis aspects, and possible use of 
these compounds as drugs in treatment of cancer. A silent crisis persists in 
cancer treatment in developing countries, and it is intensifying every year. 
Although at least 50-60% of cancer victims can benefit from radiotherapy that 
destroys cancerous tumors, but search for the paramount therapy which will prove 
to be inexpensive with minimal side effects still persists. Various treatment 
modalities have been prescribed, along with conventional and non-conventional 
medicine but due to their adverse effects and dissatisfaction among users, these 
treatments are not satisfactory enough to give relief to patients. Hence, this 
review sparks the occurrence of Taraxerol (VI) and Taraxasterol (VII) in nature,

The goal of this research was to explore the preliminary anticancer properties 
of five plants namely Calotropis procera, Moringa oleifera, Millettia pinnata, 
Basela alba and Euphorbia neriifolia available in Jharkhand which is used for 
the medicinal purpose by local tribes. In the present study, plant leaves from 
five species were collected, dried and extracted with solvents of increasing 
polarity, followed by assessment of their cytotoxicity in A549 non-small-cell 
lung cancer cells. In the antimicrobial assay, the methanol extract of the M. 
pinnata leaves exhibited comparatively higher zone of inhibition of 
0.7 ± 0.20 cm against a Salmonella typhi culture than the other extracts. M. 
pinnata leaves extract also displayed the maximum percentage inhibition in the 
DPPH, 83.97 ± 0.01 FRAP, 193.14 ± 3.01 mM assays. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity 
of the chloroform (37.45 ± 1.04) and ethyl acetate extracts (34.20 ± 0.81) of M. 
pinnata against A549 cells was found relatively higher with respect to another 
extract. In contrast, a study with the L132 normal epithelial lung cell line 
revealed less toxicity from the chloroform extract (0.33 ± 0.19) compared to the 
ethyl acetate extract (6.65 ± 0.59). Based on these findings, phytochemical 
investigation on chloroform and ethyl acetate extract of M. pinnata was 
performed using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis revealing the presence of β-sitosterol, 
lanceolatin B, karanjin, and stigmasterol. Congruently, a complete phytochemical 
and cytotoxic investigation of the M. pinnata extract constituents might infer 
the potency of this extract/s as anticancer, antioxidant and antimicrobial 
agents.

The present study was carried out to evaluate the anticancer, antioxidant, and 
possible anti-inflammatory properties of diverse medicinal plants frequently 
used in Indian traditional medication. The selected botanicals such as Soymida 
fembrifuga (Roxb.) A. Juss. (Miliaceae), Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers. 
(Menispermaceae), Lavandula bipinnata (L.) O. Ktze. (Lamiaceae), and Helicteres 
isora L. (Sterculiaceae) extracted in different solvents were evaluated for 
their in vitro anticancer and antioxidant activities. The results obtained 
indicate that H. isora has potent cytotoxic activity toward the selected cancer 
cells such as HeLa-B75 (34.21 ± 0.24%), HL-60 (30.25 ± 1.36%), HEP-3B (25.36 ± 
1.78%), and PN-15 (29.21 ± 0.52%). Interestingly, the selected botanicals 
selectively inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) more than (COX-1), which are the 
key enzymes implicated in inflammation. COX-2 inhibition was observed to be in 
the range of 19.66-49.52% as compared to COX-1 inhibition (3.93-19.61%). The 
results of the antioxidant study revealed that the selected plants were found to 
be effective 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl (OH), and superoxide 
radical (SOR) scavenging agents. High-performance thin layer chromatography 
(HPTLC) fingerprint of flavonoids was used as a measure of quality control of 
the selected plant samples. The results of the present findings strengthen the 
potential of the selected plants as a resource for the discovery of novel 
anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agents.

Development of drugs from plant sources (botanicals) for the treatment of cancer 
has not been successful in India, despite a plethora of medicinal plants and an 
equal number of experiments demonstrating anti-cancer activity of plant 
principles in vitro. There are several pitfalls in our approach to botanical 
drug development. Foremost is the lack of industry-academia collaborations in 
this field. Research goals in Indian academic institutions are generally 
short-term and mostly aimed at fulfilling the minimum requirements of a 
doctoral/MD or MPharm thesis. Secondly, quality assurance of herbal formulations 
is difficult to achieve and good manufacturing practices are expensive to 
implement. This could introduce bias during the biological evaluation of 
botanicals. A systematic approach covering a wide range of investigations 
including but not limited to mechanistic studies, potential herb-drug 
interactions, pharmacokinetics and bioavailability could help in the 
optimization of herbal formulations in the preclinical stage of development 
before they can be considered for clinical trials. Government initiatives such 
as Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathic have encouraged research in these 
areas, but are insufficient to promote focused and aggressive evaluation of 
potential herbs. Particular emphasis should be given to clinical 
pharmacokinetics, drug interactions and clinical trials in specific cancers for 
the evaluation of dosage, safety, efficacy and concomitant use with 
chemotherapy. Only such policies can result in meaningful evaluation of 
botanicals for cancer therapy.

Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases worldwide and the incidence is on the 
rise in both developing and developed countries. It is treated by chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy and surgery. In spite of advances in treatment strategies, cancer 
still remains a major cause of death. Research is on for development of better 
drugs which are more effective and simultaneously cause fewer side effects. 
Plants have been used for the treatment of various ailments of man and animals 
since ages. They are being screened extensively to explore the possibility of 
development of economically viable anticancer drugs. Natural products of plant 
origin currently constitute a considerable proportion of commercially available 
antineoplastic drugs. This review gives an insight into commercially available 
anticancer drugs of plant origin and also patents granted to plant derived 
components, extracts and polyherbal formulations possessing anticancer activity. 
The exhaustive work reviewed here on antineoplastic activity of various plants 
both in vitro and experimental models throughout the world will help design 
further research in this field.

India is a home for a large variety of plants with remarkable medicinal and 
pharmacological value. Traditional medicine in the form of Ayurveda, Siddha and 
Unani has used many of these plants since ancient days for treating and curing 
various ailments of the body. When it comes to issues related to reproductive 
health, people still hesitate to discuss and/or accept it openly and hence look 
for alternate and natural remedies. The various tribal populations distributed 
across different parts of the country still use these plant extracts in various 
formulations for maintenance of good health. The medical utilities of several of 
these plants have been documented; however, there are many more, whose potential 
is yet to be explored. This review discusses the role of various plants grown in 
the Indian subcontinent that have been widely used in maintaining various 
aspects of reproductive health in men such as infertility, aphrodisiac, 
contraception, libido, sexually transmitted infections and reproductive tract 
cancers as well as in treating chronic disorders.

The use of natural products derived from plants as medicines precedes even the 
recorded human history. In the past few years there were renewed interests in 
developing natural compounds and understanding their target specificity for drug 
development for many devastating human diseases. This has been possible due to 
remarkable advancements in the development of sensitive chemistry and biology 
tools. Sanguinarine is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid derived from rhizomes of 
the plant species Sanguinaria canadensis. The alkaloid can exist in the cationic 
iminium and neutral alkanolamine forms. Sanguinarine is an excellent DNA and RNA 
intercalator where only the iminium ion binds. Both forms of the alkaloid, 
however, shows binding to functional proteins like serum albumins, lysozyme and 
hemoglobin. The molecule is endowed with remarkable biological activities and 
large number of studies on its various activities has been published 
potentiating its development as a therapeutic agent particularly for chronic 
human diseases like cancer, asthma, etc. In this article, we review the 
properties of this natural alkaloid, and its diverse medicinal applications in 
relation to how it modulates cell death signaling pathways and induce apoptosis 
through different ways, its utility as a therapeutic agent for chronic diseases 
and its biological effects in animal and human models. These data may be useful 
to understand the therapeutic potential of this important and highly abundant 
alkaloid that may aid in the development of sanguinarine-based therapeutic 
agents with high efficacy and specificity.

ETHNOBOTANICAL RELEVANCE: Trillium govanianum Wall. ex D. Don (Melanthiaceae) is 
valued as a traditional medicinal herb in the Himalayan region. Applications 
include treatment of cancer, hypertension, neurasthenia, giddiness, arthritis, 
dysentery, inflammation, sepsis and reproductive disorders. Its range is highly 
specific, and limited to cold, shaded and moist habitats at 2400-3500 m a.s.l. 
Rhizomes are gathered from wild populations for trade, and this has recently 
emerged as a significant source of income among indigenous people of the Indian 
Himalayan region.
AIM: To assess the impact of changing rhizome prices on T. govanianum in the 
Indian Himalayan region by observing the status of existing populations and 
assessing the typical methods used for gathering and trade of rhizomes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ecological attributes were assessed in 17 sites from 
Tirthan Valley (Himachal Pradesh), Munsiyari and Tunghnath (Uttarakhand). 
Socio-economic attributes assessed through communal focus groups and interviews 
with 579 medicinal plants gatherers and 19 traders, using semi-structured open 
ended questionnaires.
RESULTS: Population decline was highest in Munsiyari, followed by Tirthan Valley 
and Tunghnath, indicating that the species may become locally extinct in some 
areas. Methods used for gathering did not consider regeneration.
CONCLUSION: Gathering of T. govanianum from wild populations is unselective and 
unmanaged, raising the potential threat of local extinctions. Sustainable 
utilization and effective conservation is needed to protect the species and 
maintain community incomes. A status of 'threatened' is justified for the 
species in the Indian Himalayan region, due to its slow life cycle, specific 
habitat requirement, low population density, and commercial value.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Butea monosperma belonging to family Fabaceae is 
used in the Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda) for various ailments 
including abdominal tumors and possess anti-estrogenic activity.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study is aimed at investigating the 
chemo-preventive potential of Butea monosperma in breast cancer and elucidating 
it's mechanism of action by assessing its effect on key processes like 
apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis.
METHODS: Cytotoxic potential of methanol extract of Butea monosperma flower 
(MEBM) was tested in MCF-7 (estrogen receptor positive), MDA-MB-231 (triple 
negative) and MDA-MB-453 (HER2 positive) human breast cancer cells by MTT assay. 
Chemo-preventive potential was evaluated in-vivo in Methylnitrosourea (MNU) 
induced mammary cancer in nulliparous Sprague-Dawley rats. The mechanism for 
anticancer potential was screened by in-vitro studies involving Annexin V- FITC 
assay (apoptosis), Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane assay (angiogenesis) and 
Migration assay (metastasis). Statistical analysis was done by one way and two 
way ANOVA (for Growth Rate and feed consumption efficiency) followed by post hoc 
Bonferroni's test with P value < 0.05.
RESULTS: It is observed that the exposure of MEBM, at various concentrations and 
time intervals to different cell lines, resulted in decreased cell 
proliferation. The IC50 value of MCF-7 cells was found significantly less than 
that of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells, which indicated that the extract of 
said medicinal plant were more potent inhibitors of estrogen positive breast 
cancer cells than other types of breast cancer cells in vitro. Corroborative 
evidences were acquired in MNU actuated mammary carcinogenesis where MEBM 
constricted tumor parameters, decreased expression of estrogen and progesterone, 
nucleic acid content and increased latency period. MEBM also induced apoptosis, 
inhibited angiogenesis and metastasis in-vitro.
CONCLUSION: Selective cytotoxic activity in MCF-7 estrogen positive breast 
cancer cells and inhibition of growth of mammary carcinoma in-vivo by methanol 
extract of Butea monosperma flowers (MEBM) suggests chemo-prevention through 
modulation of estrogen and progesterone receptor, apoptotic, anti-angiogenesis 
and anti-metastatic activity.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants used in traditional medicines 
are affordable, easily accessible, safer, less toxic and considered as a rich or 
efficient source of bioactive molecules for modern therapeutics. Artemisia 
nilagirica (AR) has a long history of use in Indian traditional medicine to 
combat a wide variety of diseases including cancer.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Considering the vast potential of traditional healing plants 
to deliver safer, less toxic and efficient chemotherapeutics, we have examined 
anticancer activity of ethanolic extract, bioactive fractions and sub-fractions 
of AR against different human cancer cell lines along with their phytochemical 
analysis to understand the insights of novel anticancer activities for further 
preclinical studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh plant material of AR was procured from the wild, 
dried and ground. The grinded materials was extracted in ethanol (AR-01) and 
fractionated into butanol (AR-02), ethyl acetate (AR-03), hexane (AR-04) and 
water (AR-05). The cytotoxicity was evaluated against three different human 
cancer cell lines, i.e. colon (DLD-1), lung (A-549), and breast (MCF-7) using 
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay along with non-cancerous VERO cells as control and 
doxorubicin (DOX) as positive control. As we observed strong cytotoxicity of 
AR-03 and AR-04 fractions against tested cells and marked cytotoxic effects 
particularly in colon cancer cell lines, we further re-fractionated, AR-03 into 
(AR-03A, AR-03B, AR-03C, AR-03D, AR-03E) and AR-04 into (AR-04A, AR-04B, AR-04C) 
sub-fractions by column chromatography and investigated against the same panel 
of cell lines in addition to one more colon cancer cell line (HT-29). 
Phytochemical analysis was performed through HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS fragmentation.
RESULTS: Ethyl acetate (AR-03) and hexane (AR-04) fractions were found to be the 
most cytotoxic against all the tested cell lines. Further, AR-03E and AR-04A 
sub-fractions were found more specific cytotoxic selectively against DLD-1 
cancer cell lines at 100µg/ml concentration. HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS determination 
revealed the presence of 17 compounds in AR-01. Among them, 4 compounds were 
reported for the first time in this species. However, 3 identified compounds 
(artemorin, β-santonin and caryophyllene oxide) in AR-03E sub-fraction were 
commonly present in each bioactive fraction and may be considered as potential 
and safest cytotoxic agents for anticancer activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Experimental evidences reported in this paper for anticancer 
activity validate the traditional wisdom of Artemisia nilagirica as an 
anticancer herbal drug. To our knowledge, this is our first novel observation of 
cytotoxicity and selectivity of ethyl acetate and hexane sub-fraction of AR-01 
i.e. AR-03E and AR-04A respectively against DLD-1 human cancer cell lines. 
HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS determination attributes the identification of cytotoxic 
compounds which may be used for further preclinical studies.

Plants have many medicinal properties including anticancer activity due to the 
presence of several secondary metabolites. Current cancer treatment policies are 
not much effective because of side effects and resistance development. 
Therefore, the discovery of new phytotherapeutics with no or fewer side effects 
is highly needed. Pterospermum acerifolium (L.) wild, an angiosperm has a broad 
application in traditional Indian medicinal system including cancer treatment. 
Despite, there is no study available on the cytotoxic and apoptotic effect of P. 
acerifolium in human cancer cells. Exploring the medicinal properties of P. 
acerifolium plant by its traditional use will be helpful towards developing 
novel cancer therapeutics. Hence, we decided to demonstrate the 
anti-carcinogenic property of P. acerifolium ethanolic bark extract against lung 
(A549) and pancreatic (PANC-1) cancer cells. The cytotoxicity was demonstrated 
by MTT assay, morphological changes, and scratch invasion assay. Flow cytometry, 
fluorescence staining techniques, and cell cycle analysis were confirmed the 
apoptotic property of P. acerifolium plant. The cell viability assay revealed 
that P. acerifolium ethanolic bark extract significantly reduced the viability 
of both A549 and PANC-1 cells. Moreover, PANC-1 cells showed more sensitivity 
towards P. acerifolium ethanolic bark extract than A549 at higher 
concentrations. Clear visualization of changes such as cytoplasmic condensation, 
cellular morphology, cell shrinkage, and augmented number of dead cells in both 
the cancer cells was observed after treatment. Scratch and invasion assay showed 
that cell migration and invasion rate of both the cancer cells were 
significantly reduced. Fluorescence microscopic studies using acridine 
orange/ethidium bromide and DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining 
showed early and late apoptotic symptoms after treatment with bark extract. 
Rhodamine-123 and DCFH-DA staining analysis by fluorescence and flow cytometry 
showed that bark extract depolarized the mitochondria membrane potential and 
induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Cell cycle analysis through 
flow cytometry using propidium iodide stain showed that P. acerifolium bark 
extract arrested A549 and PANC-1 cells in sub-G1 phase stated early apoptosis. 
These findings collectively point to the fact that P. acerifolium bark extract 
induced cell cytotoxicity in lung and pancreatic cancer cells by modulating 
mitochondrial-mediated ROS generation, and cell cycle checkpoints.

Withania somnifera is one of the most valued plants and is extensively used in 
Indian, Unani, and African systems of traditional medicine. It possess a wide 
array of therapeutic properties including anti-arthritic, anti-aging, 
anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, chemoprotective, 
cardioprotective, and recovery from neurodegenerative disorders. With the 
growing realization of benefits and associated challenges in the improvement of 
W. somnifera, studies on exploration of genetic and chemotypic variations, 
identification and characterization of important genes, and understanding the 
secondary metabolites production and their modulation has gained significant 
momentum. In recent years, several in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies have 
facilitated the validation of therapeutic potential of the phytochemicals 
derived from W. somnifera and have provided necessary impetus for gaining deeper 
insight into the mechanistic aspects involved in the mode of action of these 
important pharmaceutically active constituents. The present review highlights 
some of the current developments and future prospects of biotechnological 
intervention in this important medicinal plant.

Plants have proved to be an important source of anti-cancer drugs. Wrightia 
arborea, an Indian Ayurvedic medicinal plant, is used traditionally to treat a 
variety of ailments. This study evaluates the antiproliferative/apoptotic 
potential of Wrightia arborea leaf extracts, prepared in different organic 
solvents, on cancer cell lines. MTT assay, light and fluorescence microscopy, 
flow cytometry, DNA laddering, alkaline comet assay, and western blotting were 
some of the techniques used for evaluation. Combinations of camptothecin, either 
with CHK1 inhibitor-PD407824 or with W. arborea leaf extract, were deployed to 
determine the G2 abrogating potential of the extract. The chloroform extract 
(WAC) selectively killed K562 cells, without affecting cancerous MCF-7, Hep G2 
cells, and normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Cell death was 
characterized by observation of apoptotic bodies, increased Ca2+ and ROS, 
phosphatidyl serine externalization, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, DNA 
laddering, increased sub-G1 population, and altered expression of caspase 3, -9, 
and PARP. WAC also induced DNA damage, alterations in key G2/M phase protein 
expression, cell cycle perturbation, and potent G2 abrogation. The present study 
showed that W. arborea leaf extract, WAC, is capable of selectively killing 
leukemic cancer cells leaving normal lymphocytes unaffected. Our results 
indicate that this is effectuated through DNA damage and G2 abrogation leading 
to mitochondrial apoptosis. Taken together, this report contributes toward a 
better understanding of the anticancer properties of this traditional medicinal 
plant extract possessing valuable bioactive constituents which can serve as a 
bioresource for promising complimentary/alternative/chemopreventive 
therapeutics.

In the recent years, the interest and research in medicinal plants have 
increased in a great deal. Ayurvedic medicines and formulations developed from 
ancient Indian herbal systems are renowned for their various important 
applications. Berberis aristata - an Indian medicinal plant, which belongs to 
the family Berberidaceae is an ayurvedic herb used since ancient times. It is 
also known as Indian berberi, Daruharidra, Daruhaldi, Darvi and Chitra. The 
plant is useful as anti-pyretic, anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, 
anti-hepatotoxic, anti-hyperglycaemic, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and 
anti-lipidemic agent. B. aristata extracts and its formulations are also useful 
in the treatment of diarrhoea, haemorrhoids, gynaecological disorders, HIV-AIDS, 
osteoporosis, diabetes, eye and ear infections, wound healing, jaundice, skin 
diseases and malarial fever. This review aims to highlight the ethnobotany, 
pharmacognosy and pharmacological uses of B. aristata which will give insights 
in developing potentially new bioactives from the plant scaffolds. This review 
will also highlight the patenting trends, the new compositions developed using 
the actives from B. aristata and the different assignees involved in filing 
patents.

Herbal medicine which involves the use of plants for their medicinal value, 
dates as far back as the origin of mankind and demonstrates an array of 
applications including cardiovascular protection and anti-cancer activities, via 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and metabolic activities. Even today the 
popularity of medicinal herbs is still growing like in traditional medicines 
such as the Indian medicine, Ayurveda. One of the Ayurvedic medicinal plants is 
Withania somnifera Dunal, of which the important constituents are the 
withanolides. Among them, Withaferin A is one of the most bioactive compounds, 
exerting anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic but also anti-invasive and 
anti-angiogenic effects. In the context of modern pharmacology, a better insight 
in the underlying mechanism of the broad range of bioactivities exerted by 
Withaferin A is compulsory. Therefore, a lot of effort was made to explore the 
intracellular effects of Withaferin A and to characterize its target proteins. 
This review provides a decisive insight on the molecular basis of the 
health-promoting potential of Withaferin A.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths throughout the world. 
Extracts of medicinal plants are believed to contain different chemopreventive 
or chemotherapeutic compounds. In this study, we determined the anti-cancer 
property of one of the traditional Indian medicine Rasagenthi Lehyam (RL) for 
the treatment of lung cancer. Two lung cancer cell lines (A-549 and H-460) and 
one normal bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cell line were used to test the 
chemotherapeutic effect of RL. Out of five fractions of RL, chloroform fraction 
of RL (cRL) demonstrated a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and 
induction of apoptosis in A-549 and H-460 cells but not in normal BEAS-2B cells. 
The cRL fraction up-regulated the pro-apoptotic genes p53 and Bax and induced 
caspase-3 activation, and down-regulated the pro-survival gene Bcl-2 in both the 
lung cancer cell lines. Also, nuclear export of p53 was seen in cRL-treated lung 
cancer cells. In addition, cRL induced G2/M arrest of cell cycle and enhanced 
the radio-sensitivity of both the lung cancer cell lines. This study suggests 
that cRL may prove to be a potent anti-cancer agent that may be used for the 
treatment of lung cancer. However, further studies are required to bring cRL 
into the mainstream of medicine in the treatment of lung cancer.

Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Wall. ex Nees. (AP) is a hermaphroditic, 
self-compatible, and habitual inbreeding plant. Its main bioactive component is 
andrographolide, which is capable of inducing autophagic cell death in some 
human cancer cells and helps fight HIV/AIDS. Increasing the andrographolide 
content by investigating the genetic mechanisms controlling its biosynthesis in 
order to improve and develop high-yielding cultivars are the main breeding 
targets for AP. However, there might exist some limitations or barriers for 
crossability within AP accessions. Recently, this problem was addressed in AP by 
using a combination of crossbreeding and biotechnology-aided genetic methods. 
This review emphasizes that development of a breeding platform in a 
hard-to-breed plant, such as AP, requires the involvement of a broad range of 
methods from classical genetics to molecular breeding. To this end, a 
phenological stage (for example, flowering and stigma development) can be 
simplified to a quantitative morphological trait (for example, bud or stigma 
length) to be used as an index to express the highest level of receptivity in 
order to manage outcrossing. The outcomes of the basic crossability research can 
be then employed in diallel mating and crossbreeding. This review explains how 
genomic data could produce useful information regarding genetic distance and its 
influence on the crossability of AP accessions. Our review indicates that 
co-dominant DNA markers, such as microsatellites, are also capable of resolving 
the evolutionary pathway and cryptic features of plant populations and such 
information can be used to select the best breeding strategy. This review also 
highlights the importance of proteomic analysis as a breeding tool. In this 
regard, protein diversification, as well as the impact of normal and 
stress-responsive proteins on morphometric and physiological behaviors, could be 
used in breeding programs. These findings have immense potential for improving 
plant production and, therefore, can be regarded as prospective breeding 
platforms for medicinal plants that have an autogamous mode of reproduction. 
Finally, this review suggests that novel site-directed genome editing approaches 
such as TALENs (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) and CRISPR 
(clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 
(CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease) systems together with other new plant 
breeding technologies (NPBT) should simultaneously be taken into consideration 
for improvement of pharmaceutical plants.

BACKGROUND: Candidiasis is one of the most common opportunistic infections 
caused by Candida albicans. Fluconazole is the drug of choice for prevention and 
management of this condition. However, the emergence of fluconazole resistant 
candidal strains has become a major concern. Many herbs like fenugreek, 
cinnamon, papaya, oregano, garlic are rich in phytochemical constituents known 
to express antimycotic activity. With the available information, the present 
research study was carried out to assess the invitro anti-mycotic activity of 
hydro alcoholic extracts of Trigonella foenum-graecum seeds, Cinnamomum verum 
bark and Carica papaya leaves and seeds against fluconazole resistant Candida 
albicans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydro alcoholic extracts of Trigonella foenum-graecum 
(seeds), Cinnamomum verum (bark), Carica papaya CO.2 strain (male and female 
leaves) and Carica papaya CO.2 strain (seeds) were prepared by maceration. The 
anti-mycotic activity of the prepared extracts against Candida albicans was 
assessed by agar well diffusion method. Three independent experiments were 
performed in triplicates and the mean and standard deviation were calculated. 
Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined.
RESULTS: The results of the present study revealed that all the extracts 
exhibited anti-mycotic activity in a dose dependent manner and minimum 
inhibitory concentration of all the extracts was found to be 15.62 μg/ml.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study shed light on the fact that plant 
extracts could be used not only as an alternate drug for management of 
fluconazole resistant candidiasis but also explored further for oral cancer 
prevention as a therapeutic adjunct.

Natural products are important sources of anti-cancer lead molecules. Many 
successful anti-cancer drugs are natural products or their analogues. Many more 
are under clinical trials. The present review focuses on chemopreventive and 
anti-cancer activities of polar and non-polar extracts, semi purified fractions 
and pure molecules from terrestrial plants of India reported between 2005 and 
2010 emphasizing possible mechanisms of action of pure molecules.

The rural population in India faces a number of health problems and often has to 
rely on local remedies. Psidium guajava Linn. (guava), a tropical plant which is 
used as food and medicine can be used by rural communities due to its several 
medicinal properties. A literature search was undertaken to gauge the rural 
health scenario in India and compile the available literature on guava so as to 
reflect its usage in the treatment of multiple health conditions prevalent in 
rural communities. Towards this, electronic databases such as Pubmed, Science 
Direct, google scholar were scanned. Information on clinical trials on guava was 
obtained from Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and 
Clinicaltrial.gov. The literature survey revealed that guava possesses various 
medicinal properties which have been reported from across the globe in the form 
of ethnobotanical/ethnopharmacological surveys, laboratory investigations and 
clinical trials. Besides documenting the safety of guava, the available 
literature shows that guava is efficacious against the following conditions 
which rural communities would encounter. (a) Gastrointestinal infections; (b) 
Malaria; (c)Respiratory infections; (d) Oral/dental infections; (e) Skin 
infections; (f) Diabetes; (g) Cardiovascular/hypertension; (h) Cancer; (i) 
Malnutrition; (j) Women problems; (k) Pain; (l) Fever; (m) Liver problems; (n) 
Kidney problems. In addition, guava can also be useful for treatment of animals 
and explored for its commercial applications. In conclusion, popularization of 
guava, can have multiple applications for rural communities.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: There are more than 3000 officially documented 
plants in the Indian subcontinent that hold great medicinal potential. One such 
under-explored plant is an evergreen tropical tree Neolamarckia cadamba (Roxb.) 
Bosser (Rubiaceae). It is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions 
of the world and has therapeutic potential against many diseases such as 
diabetes, anaemia, stomatitis, leprosy, cancer and infectious diseases. 
Neolamarckia cadamba has historical existence in India and it is mentioned in 
mythical stories. There are several reports on medicinal values of root, bark 
and leaves of N. cadamba; but the literature on its fruits is scanty. Therefore, 
the present review aims to provide updated comprehensive information on the 
phytochemistry and pharmacological properties of different parts of N. cadamba 
tree with special reference to its fruit, in order to open new perspectives for 
future food and pharmacological research.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed on N. cadamba using 
ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, 
unpublished materials, government survey reports and scientific databases such 
as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Google Scholar and other web 
search engines (Google, Yahoo). The Plant List, International Plant Name Index 
and Kew Botanical Garden Plant name databases were used to validate the 
scientific names.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Neolamarckia cadamba is one of the economically 
important trees, which is being exploited for paper, pulp and wood industry. In 
folk medicine, various parts of N. cadamba are used in the treatment of various 
ailments such as fever, uterine complaints, blood diseases, skin diseases, 
tumour, anaemia, eye inflammation and diarrhoea. Other reported uses of N. 
cadamba include antihepatotoxic, antimalarial, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, 
antipyretic, diuretic and laxative. Various phytochemicals such as cadambine and 
its derivatives (dihydrocadambine and isodihydrocadambine) and indole alkaloids 
(Neolamarckines) were isolated from the leaves; whereas the presence of quinovic 
acid derivatives have been reported in the bark of N. cadamba.
CONCLUSION: The present review compiles information on an ethnopharmacologically 
useful plant N. cadamba. Bioactive compounds responsible for its various 
medicinal properties and their effects at the molecular level need to be 
investigated in more detail. Furthermore, the detailed study of toxicity and 
pharmacological properties of extracts as well as molecules in N. cadamba is 
required to confirm the ethnomedicinal claims of N. cadamba for food and 
pharmaceutical applications.

The medicinal properties of the most successful plant in the deserts of the 
western hemisphere, the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), are evidenced by the 
long traditional usage of the plants by the Native Americans Indian tribes in 
Southwestern North America and the Amerindians from South America. The plant is 
rich in simple bisphenyl lignans and tricyclic lignans known as cyclolignans. 
These compounds are responsible for many of the pharmacological activities of 
extracts of the plants. Some of these activities, namely antiherpes, 
antioxidant, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory, were known a century ago. Only 
recently have further studies revealed other crucial activities of the same 
plant molecules as powerful agents against human immunodeficiency virus, human 
papillomavirus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and symptoms of aging. 
Molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral and anticancer activities have 
been elucidated and involve the inhibition of SP1 dependent gene transcription. 
This review summarizes the recent findings on creosote bush lignans. We 
introduce the concept of a cocktail of safe well-characterized natural products 
from the creosote bush that would represent a bridge between oriental herbal 
medicines and Western drug-based therapies.

It is estimated that 80% of the world population depends on traditional medicine 
for primary healthcare need. Trianthema portulacastrum Linn. (family: Aizoaceae) 
is a small perennial weed found in the Americas, Africa, India, and other 
regions of the world. This plant is used extensively in Indian traditional 
medicines and is also consumed as a vegetable throughout Asia for its perceived 
health benefits. Phytochemical analysis of T. portulacastrum reveals the 
presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, saponins, and phenolic compounds. 
Emerging studies demonstrate that crude extracts as well as bioactive 
phytoconstituents of T. portulacastrum exhibit potent antioxidant, 
anti-infective, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities. A growing number of 
in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate various biological and pharmacological 
activities, including prevention and amelioration of hepatotoxicity, 
nephrotoxicity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, infectious diseases and cancer. 
This review aims to present and analyze available literature to understand the 
full potential of T. portulacastrum in health promotion and disease prevention. 
Current limitations and future directions of research on this medicinal and 
dietary plant are also critically discussed.

Physicians and patients have been frustrated by the lack of reliable information 
on unconventional therapies. To help fill this gap in the area of breast cancer 
therapy, the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative formed a task force to 
advise it on how best to promote research into unconventional therapies. As part 
of the work of the task force, a review of the available literature was carried 
out for each of the following products: Essiac, green tea, Iscador, hydrazine 
sulfate, vitamins A, C and E, and 714-X. The first article in this series on 
unconventional therapies for cancer describes the methodology used to obtain and 
evaluate the information and provides a summary of the findings on Essiac. 
Subsequent articles will cover the other products. For most of the products 
reviewed, there has been some indication of possible benefit but no definitive 
evidence. Innovative and collaborative research needed to meet the information 
needs of growing numbers of patients and their physicians is now being sponsored 
by the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative. Open communication between 
patients and physicians is also necessary for the maintenance of an appropriate 
therapeutic partnership and for the identification and control of side effects. 
The Ontario Division of the Canadian Cancer Society, a partner in the Canadian 
Breast Cancer Research Initiative, supported the preparation of a 
patient-information piece on unconventional therapies to accompany the series. 
This item will assist patients who are considering such therapies and will 
promote open communication between patients and their physicians.

Cancer or uncontrolled cell proliferation is a major health issue worldwide and 
is the second leading cause of deaths globally. The high mortality rate and 
toxicity associated with cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy have 
encouraged the investigation of complementary and alternative treatment methods, 
such as plant-based drugs. Moreover, over 60% of the anti-cancer drugs are 
molecules derived from plants or their synthetic derivatives. Therefore, in the 
present review, an attempt has been made to summarize the cytotoxic plants 
available in the Indian subcontinent along with a description of their 
bio-active components. The review covers 99 plants of 57 families as well as 
over 110 isolated bioactive cytotoxic compounds, amongst which at least 20 are 
new compounds. Among the reported phytoconstituents, artemisinin, lupeol, 
curcumin, and quercetin are under clinical trials, while brazilin, catechin, 
ursolic acid, β-sitosterol, and myricetin are under pharmacokinetic development. 
However, for the remaining compounds, there is little or no information 
available. Therefore, further investigations are warranted on these subcontinent 
medicinal plants as an important source of novel cytotoxic agents.

OBJECTIVES: Selaginella bryopteris L. (family: Selaginaceae), is often used in 
traditional Indian systems of medicine for the prevention and cure of several 
disorders and for the treatment of patient with spermatorrhoea, venereal 
disease, constipation, colitis, urinary tract infections, fever, epilepsy, 
leucorrhoea, beri-beri and cancer. It is also used as a strength tonic. This 
study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects 
of topically administered aqueous, polar and non-polar methanolic fractions (10 
mg/20 μL) of Selaginella bryopteris.
METHODS: An acute oral toxicity study of Selaginella bryopteris at doses from 
250 to 2,000 mg/kg body weight (bw) was performed. Aqueous, polar and non-polar 
methanolic extracts (10 mg/20 μL) applied topically for 5 days were evaluated 
for their anti-inflammatory effects against 12-tetra-O-decanoyl phorbol acetate 
(TPA)-induced inflammation by using the redness in the ear, the ear's weight 
(edema), oxidative stress parameters, such as lipid-peroxide (LPO) and nitric 
oxide (NO), and the pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammation, such as 
tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6. Indomethacine (0.5 
mg/20 μL) was used for the positive control.
RESULTS: Selaginella bryopteris produced no mortalities when administered orally 
at doses from 250 to 2,000 mg/kg bw. Topical treatment with the non-polar 
methanolic fraction (10 mg/20 αL) significantly suppressed redness (2.4 ± 0.5) 
and edema (30.4 ± 1) and effectively reduced the LPO level (32.3 ± 3.3). The NO 
level was (8.07 ± 0.55), and the TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels were decreased to 
69.6 ± 15.5, 7.7 ± 4.8 and 82.6 ± 5.9, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated for the first time the mechanisms underlying 
the anti-inflammatory effect of medicinal plants like Selaginella bryopteris and 
quantified the pharmacological interactions between them. The present study 
showed this herbal product to be a promising anti-inflammatory phytomedicine for 
the treatment of patients with inflammatory skin diseases.

Many common diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer are 
caused or exacerbated by disparate physiological, pathological, environmental, 
and lifestyle factors. However, the chief aim of current drug discovery 
approaches is to search for single-entity drugs that interact with well-defined 
molecular targets (a single receptor or enzyme). The concept of multi-target 
drugs or multi-component therapy is gaining increased attention with the 
discovery that many diseases (like hypertension) are best treated by multi-drug 
or multi-target therapies. Traditional medicines, such as traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) and Indian Ayurveda, have been re-evaluated and are becoming 
important resources for the discovery of bioactive molecules with therapeutic 
effects and for designing multi-targets drugs. This article provides an overview 
of new strategies and techniques to design therapeutic regimes that comprise 
more than one active ingredient to produce synergistic effects by simultaneously 
interacting with multiple molecular targets. Advances in phytochemistry, high 
throughput screening, DNA sequencing, systems biology, and bioinformatics can 
reveal the chemical composition and molecular mechanisms of TCM and together 
provide a new template for the early stages of drug discovery. Meanwhile, 
clinical knowledge of TCM provides a promising framework for multi-component 
drug design. A renaissance of multi-component drug discovery inspired by 
traditional medicine is possible.

Viola odorata L. (Violaceae), an Indian medicinal plant, contains a plethora of 
cyclotides, which are a class of cyclic peptides derived from plants, possessing 
several applications. Somatic embryo culture of V. odorata was developed, via 
indirect somatic embryogenesis, to serve as an alternative to natural plant 
biomass for sustainable and continuous production of its bioactive ingredients, 
such as cyclotides. Among the various combinations of phytohormones tested, 
Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 1 mg/l thidiazuron gave rise to the 
maximum frequency of induction (86.7%) and a high number of somatic embryos (3) 
from an embryogenic callus. Identification and characterization of cyclotides in 
the somatic embryos were carried out using a Fourier transform mass spectrometer 
coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-FTMS). Among the cyclotides identified in 
the study, few were found to be exclusively present in the somatic embryo 
culture. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the cyclotides was higher in 
somatic embryo extract than in the natural plant extract. The biological 
activities (cytotoxic, haemolytic and antimicrobial) of the somatic embryos and 
the parent plant were compared. Unlike the natural plants, the somatic embryo 
extracts demonstrated specificity i.e. they were found to be potent against 
cancerous cells but not against non-cancerous cell line or red blood cells. In 
contrast to the plant extract, the somatic embryos extracts were found to be 
potent against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. These results suggest 
that somatic embryos of V. odorata (rich in cyclotides) can be used as an 
alternative to plant biomass for its therapeutic applications and germplasm 
conservation.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Stephania rotunda Lour. (Menispermaceae) is an 
important traditional medicinal plant that is grown in Southeast Asia. The 
stems, leaves, and tubers have been used in the Cambodian, Lao, Indian and 
Vietnamese folk medicine systems for years to treat a wide range of ailments, 
including asthma, headache, fever, and diarrhoea.
AIM OF THE REVIEW: To provide an up-to-date, comprehensive overview and analysis 
of the ethnobotany, phytochemistry, and pharmacology of Stephania rotunda for 
its potential benefits in human health, as well as to assess the scientific 
evidence of traditional use and provide a basis for future research directions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peer-reviewed articles on Stephania rotunda were acquired 
via an electronic search of the major scientific databases (Pubmed, Google 
Scholar, and ScienceDirect). Data were collected from scientific journals, 
theses, and books.
RESULTS: The traditional uses of Stephania rotunda were recorded in countries 
throughout Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and India). Different parts 
of Stephania rotunda were used in traditional medicine to treat about twenty 
health disorders. Phytochemical analyses identified forty alkaloids. The roots 
primarily contain l-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP), whereas the tubers contain 
cepharanthine and xylopinine. Furthermore, the chemical composition differs from 
one region to another and according to the harvest period. The alkaloids 
exhibited approximately ten different pharmacological activities. The main 
pharmacological activities of Stephania rotunda alkaloids are antiplasmodial, 
anticancer, and immunomodulatory effects. Sinomenine, cepharanthine, and 
l-stepholidine are the most promising components and have been tested in humans. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters have been studied for seven compounds, including 
the three most promising compounds. The toxicity has been evaluated for 
liriodenine, roemerine, cycleanine, l-tetrahydropalmatine, and oxostephanine.
CONCLUSION: Stephania rotunda is traditionally used for the treatment of a wide 
range of ailments. Pharmacological investigations have validated different uses 
of Stephania rotunda in folk medicine. The present review highlights the three 
most promising compounds of Stephania rotunda, which could constitute potential 
leads in various medicinal fields, including malaria and cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cytotoxic activities of crude extracts and solvent 
fractions of Spermacoce verticillata, Ficus pumila and Flemingia strobilifera 
against a MT-4 human leukaemia cancer cell line.
METHODS: Crude extracts of dried leaves of S verticillata, F pumila and F 
strobilifera were made by exhaustive methanol extraction, fractions were 
obtained from sequential extraction of the crude extract using solvents of 
increasing polarity. Dose responses corresponding to cell survival following 
72-hour exposure to the extracts were determined using a leukaemia cancer cell 
line (MT-4). Cell viability was assessed using the MTT[3-(4, 
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay reading 
absorbances at 570 nm. Comparisons were made with controls and cell survival, in 
each sample well, was determined based on the ratio of the absorbance of the 
sample to the control.
RESULTS: Crude extracts of S verticillata, F pumila and F strobilifera displayed 
cytotoxicity and the IC50 values were 89 microg/ml, 131 microg/ml and 81 
microg/ml, respectively. The petroleum ether and chloroform fractions of the 
crude extracts of S verticillata and F strobilifera showed potent cytotoxic 
activity but the highest cytotoxic activity was found in the chloroform and 
butanol fractions of F pumila with IC50 values of 23 microg/ml and 26 microg/ml, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The crude extracts of S verticillata, F pumila and F strobilifera 
were shown to be cytotoxic to the leukaemia cell line, MT-4 and IC50 values were 
determined. Fractionation of the crude extracts by solvent-solvent extraction 
enabled determination of the active fractions and their IC50 values. We propose 
that cytotoxic activity may be due to antioxidant compounds previously isolated 
from these plants.

BACKGROUND: Cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality and is a major 
public health problem worldwide. Breast cancer is a leading cause of 
cancer-associated mortality in women, and the incidence is also on the rise in 
the entire world. Medicinal plants have been an important source of several 
clinically useful anticancer agents.
AIM: In this study, we studied the growth inhibitory effect of asafoetida and 
its essential oil and ferulic acid on antitumor activity using mouse breast 
cancer cell line.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this aim, cells were exposed to these components at 
different concentrations and for different time durations. 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was 
carried out to characterize the cytotoxicity of the constituents used.
RESULTS: Our results showed that all three constituents could inhibit 4T1 cell 
proliferation. Our MTT assay results showed a significant cytotoxicity effect in 
a time- and concentration-dependent manner. It also demonstrated that essential 
oil of asafoetida has a stronger effect in decreasing viability breast cancer 
cells. Ferulic acid showed a significant effect only at a dose of 500 μg/ml.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of cellular carried out in this study, we 
could demonstrate that asafoetida and its essential oil and ferulic acid have 
inhibitory effect on the growth of breast cancer cell line. As evidenced from 
these preliminary results, asafoetida and its derivative constituents may be 
considered as attractive alternatives to serve as lead compounds in drug 
development for breast cancer as an adjuvant therapy. However, much remains to 
be done before such agent could be introduced to the clinic.

CONTEXT: The ethanol extracts and their fractions of three Indian medicinal 
plants, Ervatamia coronaria (Jacq.) Stapf, (Apocynaceae), Mimosa pudica L. 
(Mimosaceae) and Caesalpinia bonduc (L.) Roxb. (Caesalpiniaceae) were tested for 
their cytotoxic activity in the brine shrimp lethality (BSL) bioassay and in 
various cancer cell lines. The plants were selected based on their traditional 
use in the treatment of cancer/tumors.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in vitro cytotoxicity of Ervatamia coronaria, 
Mimosa pudica and Caesalpinia bonduc.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanolic extracts and their fractions of E. coronaria, 
M. pudica and C. bonduc were subjected to cytotoxicity studies using BSL 
bioassay method with concentrations of 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 µg/ml. The 
alkaloid fraction of E. coronaria with significant cytotoxicity in BSL bioassay 
was subjected to in vitro cytotoxicity studies with HT-29, A-549, HepG-2, MCF-7 
and L-6 cell lines at concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/ml and a 
DNA fragmentation study using the HT-29 cell line.
RESULTS: The alkaloid fractions of E. coronaria and M. pudica showed significant 
cytotoxicity with LC50 values of 65.83 and 85.10 µg/ml in the BSL bioassay, 
respectively. The purified alkaloid fraction of E. coronaria exhibited highest 
cytotoxicity in HT-29, A-549 and MCF-7 cell lines with IC50 values of 32.5, 47.5 
and 72.5 µg/ml, respectively, and induced DNA fragmentation in the HT-29 cell 
line at a concentration of 65 µg/ml.
CONCLUSION: The alkaloid fraction of E. coronaria exhibited significant 
cytotoxicity. Alkaloids such as ervatamine, apparicine and coronaridine that 
were earlier reported may be responsible for this activity.

AIM: To explore the potential of Rosellinia sanctae-cruciana an endophytic 
fungus associated with Albizia lebbeck for pharmaceutically important cytotoxic 
compounds.
METHODS AND RESULTS: One novel cytochalasin, named jammosporin A (1) and four 
known analogues (2-5) were isolated from the culture of the endophytic fungus R. 
sanctae-cruciana, harboured from the leaves of the medicinal plant A. lebbeck. 
Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses including 
one-dimensional and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance data along with 
MS data and by comparison with literature reports. In preliminary screening the 
ethyl acetate extract of the fungal culture was tested for cytotoxic activity 
against a panel of four cancer cell lines (MOLT-4, A549, MIA PaCa-2 and 
MDA-MB-231), and found to be active against MOLT-4 with an IC50 value of 
10 μg ml-1 . Owing to the remarkable cytotoxic activity of the extract the 
isolated compounds (1-5) were evaluated for their cytototoxicity against the 
MOLT-4 cell line by MTT assay. Interestingly, compounds 1-2, 4 and 5 showed 
considerable cytotoxic potential against the human leukaemia cancer cell line 
(MOLT-4) with IC50 values of 20·0, 10·0, 8·0 and 6·0 μmol l-1 , respectively, 
while compound 3 showed an IC50 value of 25 μmol l-1 . This is the first report 
of the existence of this class of secondary metabolites in R. sanctae-cruciana 
fungus.
CONCLUSION: This study discovered a novel compound, named jammosporin A, 
isolated for the first time from R. sanctae-cruciana, an endophytic fungus of A. 
lebbeck with anticancer activity against the MOLT-4 cell line.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Rosellinia sanctae-cruciana represents an 
interesting source of a new compound with bioactive potential as a therapeutic 
agent against a human leukaemia cancer cell line (MOLT-4).

O6-alkylguanines are potent mutagenic, pro-carcinogenic and cytotoxic lesions 
induced by exogenous and endogenous alkylating agents. A facilitated elimination 
of these lesions by increasing the activity of O6-methylguanine-DNA 
methyltransferase (MGMT) is likely to be a beneficial chemoprevention strategy, 
which, however, has not been examined. Because, a marginal enhancement of this 
protein may be adequate for genomic protection, we studied alterations in MGMT 
activity and expression in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and cancer cell 
lines induced by water-soluble and alcohol-soluble constituents of several 
plants with established antioxidant and medicinal properties. Both the ethanolic 
and aqueous extracts from neem (Azadirachta indica), holy basil (Ocimum 
sanctum), winter cherry (Withania somnifera), and oregano (Origanum majorana) 
increased the levels of MGMT protein and its demethylation activity in a 
time-dependent manner with a maximum of 3-fold increase after 72-h treatment. 
The extracts from gooseberry (Emblica officinalis), common basil (Ocimum 
basilicum), and spearmint (Mentha viridis) were relatively less efficient in 
raising MGMT levels. Increased levels of MGMT mRNA accounted at least, in part, 
for the increased activity of the DNA repair protein. The herbal treatments also 
increased glutathione S-transferase-pi (GSTP1) expression, albeit to a lesser 
extent than MGMT. These data provide the first evidence for the upregulation of 
human MGMT by plant constituents and raise the possibility of rational dietary 
approaches for attenuating alkylation-induced carcinogenesis. Further, they 
reveal the putative antioxidant responsiveness of the MGMT gene in human cells.

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies are gaining momentum these days due to 
the plethora of various high-throughput experimental methods available for 
detecting PPIs. Proteins create complexes and networks by functioning in harmony 
with other proteins and here in silico network biology hold the promise to 
reveal new functionality of genes as it is very difficult and laborious to carry 
out experimental high-throughput genetic screens in living organisms. We 
demonstrate this approach by computationally screening C. elegans conserved 
homologs of already reported human tumor suppressor and aging associated genes. 
We select by this nhr-6, vab-3 and gst-23 as predicted longevity genes for RNAi 
screen. The RNAi results demonstrated the pro-longevity effect of these genes. 
Nuclear hormone receptor nhr-6 RNAi inhibition resulted in a C. elegans 
phenotype of 23.46% lifespan reduction. Moreover, we show that nhr-6 regulates 
oxidative stress resistance in worms and does not affect the feeding behavior of 
worms. These findings imply the potential of nhr-6 as a common therapeutic 
target for aging and cancer ailments, stressing the power of in silico PPI 
network analysis coupled with RNAi screens to describe gene function.

The concept of Ayurvedic expert guided drug discovery and development is defined 
and put to test systematically for the first time in literature. Western Science 
has explored only ~5% of the approximately 25,000 species of higher plants for 
drug leads. The ancient medical science of Ayurveda has however employed a much 
larger spectrum of plants for clinical treatment. Clerodendrum viscosum (CV), a 
commonly growing weed in the Indian subcontinent has been employed by S. 
Nirmalananda (Ayurvedic expert) for the treatment of cervical cancer. Here we 
isolate and characterize a water extract fraction (Cv-AP) from the root of CV 
and evaluate its anticervical cancer cell bioactivity. Our results indicate that 
Cv-AP possesses pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, and anti-migratory activity 
in a dose-dependent fashion against cervical cancer cell lines. In contrast, 
primary fibroblasts (control healthy cells), when exposed to similar 
concentrations of this extract, fail to undergo apoptosis and remain relatively 
unaffected. These findings suggest that Clerodendrum viscosum (CV) is a readily 
available source of components with potent anti-cancer activity and selective 
bioactivity against cervical cancer cells. The major component in CV-AP was 
identified as a glycoprotein via SDS Page and Concanavalin-A binding studies. 
This study serves to illustrate that systematic collaboration with Ayurveda is a 
practical and powerful strategy in drug discovery and development.

Breast cancer is the prime cause for cancer mortality in women worldwide. The 
importance of diverse natural and dietary agents to reduce the risk of 
developing breast cancer is well established. Berberine, a natural isoquinoline 
alkaloid found in many medicinal plants is widely used in traditional Indian and 
Chinese medicine. Because of its capability to seize the cell cycle and induce 
apoptosis of numerous malignant cells, berberine has received considerable 
attention as a potential anticancer agent. In the present study, breast cancer 
was induced in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats by intragastric administration of 7, 
12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) at a dose of 80mg/kg of body weight. 
Treatment of berberine (50mg/kg BW) to breast tumor bearing rats was found to be 
effective against DMBA induced mammary carcinoma. The increased levels of lipid 
peroxide (malonaldehyde), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α), 
enzymatic antioxidants (SOD and CAT), non-enzymatic antioxidants (GSH and 
vitamin C) and transcription factor NF-κB were decreased significantly by 
administration of berberine. Furthermore, RT-PCR and western blot analysis 
showed the down-regulation of NF-κB and PCNA in breast tumors. Histopathological 
studies validated that berberine is effective against DMBA induced ductal 
carcinoma & invasive carcinoma. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the 
preventive role of berberine against DMBA induced mammary carcinoma in SD rats.

Andrographis lineata is an herbal medicinal plant used in traditional medicine 
as a substitute for Andrographis paniculata. Here, using mature leaf explants of 
A. lineata we demonstrate for the first time the callus induction established on 
MS medium containing 1.0 mg l-1 IAA. Dried callus was subjected to solvent 
extraction with acetone. Further the acetone residue was separated by silica gel 
column chromatography, crystallized and characterized on the basis of nuclear 
magnetic resonance (proton and c13) and liquid chromatographic mass 
spectroscopy. This analysis revealed the occurrence of two known flavones 
namely, 7-O-methylwogonin (MW) and Echioidinin (ED). Furthermore, these 
compounds were tested for their cytotoxicity against leukemic cell line, CEM. We 
identify that ED and MW induced cytotoxicity in a time- and 
concentration-dependent manner. Further increase in the LDH release upon 
treatment with ED and MW further confirmed our cytotoxicity results against 
leukemic cell line. Strikingly, MW was more potent than ED when compared by 
trypan blue and MTT assays. Our results recapitulate the utility of callus 
cultures for the production of plant specific bioactive secondary metabolites 
instead of using wild plants. Together, our in vitro studies provide new 
insights of A. lineata callus cultures serving as a source for cancer 
chemotherapeutic agents.

BACKGROUND: Medicinal plants have played an important role in the development of 
clinically useful anticancer agents. Elephantopus scaber (Asteraceae) (ES) is 
widely used in Indian traditional system of medicine for the treatment of 
various ailments including cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate anticancer effects of ES in human epithelial cancer 
cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity of ethanolic extract of ES (ES-ET) and its 
fractions, such as ES Petroleum ether fraction (ES-PET), ES Dichloromethane 
fraction (ES DCM), n Butyl alcohol fraction (ES-BT), and ES-Rest (ES-R) were 
assessed in human epithelial cancer cell lines using sulforhodamine B (SRB) 
assay. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide assay and Hoechst 33342 assays were used 
to gauge induction of apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis and micronuclei assay were 
used to assess cell cycle specific pharmacological effects and drug induced 
genotoxicty. Further, the ability of ES to inhibit multi drug resistant (MDR) 
transporters (ABC-B1 and ABC-G2) was determined by Rhodamine (Rho) and 
Mitoxantrone (MXR) efflux assays.
RESULTS: The enriched fraction of ES (ES DCM) possessed dose-dependent potent 
cytotoxicity in human epithelial cancer cells. Further, treatment of cancer 
cells (HeLa, A549, MCF-7, and Caco-2) with ES DCM showed hall mark properties of 
apoptosis (membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation etc.). Similarly, ES DCM 
caused enhanced sub G0 content and micronuclei formation indicating the 
induction of apoptosis and drug induced genotoxicity in cancer cells, 
respectively. Interestingly, ES DCM inhibited MDR transporters (ABC B1 and ABC 
G2) in cancer cells.
CONCLUSION: The enriched fraction of ES imparted cytotoxic effects, triggered 
apoptosis, induced genotoxicity, and inhibited MDR transporters in human 
epithelial cancer cells. Thus, ES appears to be potential anticancer agent.

Human calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) is a member of 
Ser/Thr kinase family, and is associated with different types of cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Vanillin is a natural compound, a primary component 
of the extract of the vanilla bean which possesses varieties of pharmacological 
features including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and 
anti-tumor. Here, we have investigated the binding mechanism and affinity of 
vanillin to the CAMKIV which is being considered as a potential drug target for 
cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We found that vanillin binds strongly to 
the active site cavity of CAMKIV and stabilized by a large number of 
non-covalent interactions. We explored the utility of vanillin as anti-cancer 
agent and found that it inhibits the proliferation of human hepatocyte carcinoma 
(HepG2) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells in a dose-dependent manner. 
Furthermore, vanillin treatment resulted into the significant reduction in the 
mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ROS production that eventually leads 
to apoptosis in HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cancer cells. These findings may offer a novel 
therapeutic approach by targeting the CAMKIV using natural product and its 
derivative with a minimal side effect.

7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch 
carcinogenesis is widely preferred to assess the tumor-inhibiting efficacy of 
the medicinal plants or their constituents. The present study explores the 
tumor-inhibiting potential of esculetin by utilizing the status of lipid 
peroxidation by products (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), antioxidants 
(vitamin E, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione 
peroxidase), and phase I and phase II detoxification agents as biochemical end 
points and by using histopathological studies as well in DMBA-induced hamster 
buccal pouch carcinogenesis. Oral tumors developed in the buccal pouch were 
subjected to histopathological studies, and were confirmed as oral squamous cell 
carcinoma. Hamsters treated with DMBA alone showed an abnormal pattern of lipid 
peroxidation, antioxidants, and detoxification agents as compared to control 
hamsters. The status of the above-mentioned biochemical markers and 
histopathological abnormalities were found to be reversed in 
DMBA + esculetin-treated hamsters. The result of the present study thus 
indicates the tumor preventive potential of esculetin in DMBA-induced oral 
carcinogenesis.

AIM: Natural products discovered from medicinal plants have played an important 
role in the treatment of cancer. Methyl angolensate (MA), a tetranortriterpenoid 
obtained from the root callus of Indian Redwood tree, Soymida febrifuga Roxb. 
(A.Juss) was tested for its anticancer properties on breast cancer cells.
METHODS: Cell viability was tested using trypan blue, MTT and LDH assays. 
Tritiated thymidine assay and flowcytometry were used to study effect of MA on 
cell proliferation. The activation of apoptosis was checked by annexin V and 
JC-1 staining followed by FACS analysis. Immunoblotting analysis was used for 
studying expression of apoptotic and DNA double strand break repair proteins.
RESULTS: We find that MA inhibited the growth of breast cancer cell line, T47D 
in a time- and dose-dependent manner. MA treatment led to the inhibition of cell 
proliferation as detected by tritiated thymidine assay and flowcytometry. 
Further, MA treated cells exhibited typical apoptotic morphological changes and 
led to the accumulation of subG1 peak in cell cycle distribution. The induction 
of apoptosis was further confirmed both by annexin V staining and JC1 staining. 
We also find that MA activates MAP kinase pathway to induce apoptosis. Besides, 
we find a time dependent activation followed by degradation of DNA double-strand 
break repair proteins upon treatment with MA.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that MA induces cytotoxicity in breast cancer 
cells. Further, the altered expression of DSB repair proteins in MA treated 
cells may control the induction of apoptosis in these cancer cells.

Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.

INTRODUCTION: MMPs are metal-dependant endopeptidases capable of degrading any 
one of the components of the extracellular matrix. In normal physiological 
conditions it is regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, and any 
alteration in this regulatory process leads to pathological conditions.
AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the status of MMP research in India. The 
first research paper was published in 1998; the subsequent developments in this 
field led to an increase in the number of publications. This review highlights 
the growth of MMP research in India based on the research papers published from 
1998 to 2010. We identify four major subject areas: cancer, arthritis, ulcer and 
quantitative structure-activity relationship. The diseases involved are 
discussed along with the required steps for improving treatments.
EXPERT OPINION: Indian researchers need to work on new molecules with specific 
MMP inhibitory activity for cancer and communicable and geriatric diseases. 
Although several publications on natural products have appeared from India, they 
are very few considering the number of medicinal plants available in the 
country. Inhibiting MMPs could be both beneficial and detrimental to cells, 
owing to the inter-relationship between normal physiology and pathology; thus, 
targeting MMPs with broad MMP inhibitors can have mixed blessings.

Salacia oblonga, an inhabitant of tropical regions has been used in traditional 
Indian medicinal systems. Phytochemicals were extracted in methanol from the 
plant and analyzed for various biological activities. The results of biochemical 
tests for total phenolics (297 ± 0.005 and 275 ± 0.006) and flavonoids 
(95 ± 0.004 and 61.6 ± 0.004) in the aerial and root parts were indicated as 
Gallic acid and quercetin equivalents respectively. The Aerial and root extracts 
showed strong reducing ability based on reducing power and FRAP assays. The 
extracts exhibited significant IC50 values in DPPH, super oxide and nitric oxide 
radical scavenging assays. The extracts displayed low IC50 values (<50 μg/ml) 
when assessed for antiproliferative activity against breast cancer cell lines 
using the MTT assay. GC-MS analysis of methanolic extracts have revealed the 
presence of compounds viz. n-Hexadecanoic acid, N-Methoxy-N-methylacetamide, 
Ursa-9(11), 12-dien-3-ol, Gamma-sitosterol etc., that might be potential 
candidates for the biological activity exhibited by the extract.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Withanolides are naturally occurring chemical compounds. 
They are secondary metabolites produced via oxidation of steroids and 
structurally consist of a steroid-backbone bound to a lactone or its 
derivatives. They are known to protect plants against herbivores and have 
medicinal value including anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, adaptogenic and 
anti-oxidant effects. Withaferin A (Wi-A) and Withanone (Wi-N) are two 
structurally similar withanolides isolated from Withania somnifera, also known 
as Ashwagandha in Indian Ayurvedic medicine. Ashwagandha alcoholic leaf extract 
(i-Extract), rich in Wi-N, was shown to kill cancer cells selectively. 
Furthermore, the two closely related purified phytochemicals, Wi-A and Wi-N, 
showed differential activity in normal and cancer human cells in vitro and in 
vivo. We had earlier identified several genes involved in cytotoxicity of 
i-Extract in human cancer cells by loss-of-function assays using either siRNA or 
randomized ribozyme library.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we have employed 
bioinformatics tools on four genes, i.e., mortalin, p53, p21 and Nrf2, 
identified by loss-of-function screenings. We examined the docking efficacy of 
Wi-N and Wi-A to each of the four targets and found that the two closely related 
phytochemicals have differential binding properties to the selected cellular 
targets that can potentially instigate differential molecular effects. We 
validated these findings by undertaking parallel experiments on specific gene 
responses to either Wi-N or Wi-A in human normal and cancer cells. We 
demonstrate that Wi-A that binds strongly to the selected targets acts as a 
strong cytotoxic agent both for normal and cancer cells. Wi-N, on the other 
hand, has a weak binding to the targets; it showed milder cytotoxicity towards 
cancer cells and was safe for normal cells. The present molecular docking 
analyses and experimental evidence revealed important insights to the use of 
Wi-A and Wi-N for cancer treatment and development of new anti-cancer 
phytochemical cocktails.

CONTEXT: Dillenia (Dilleniaceae) is a genus of about 100 species of flowering 
plants in tropical and subtropical trees of Southern Asia, Australasia, and the 
Indian Ocean Islands. Until now, only eight Dillenia species have been reported 
to be used traditionally in different countries for various medical purposes. 
Out of eight species, D. pentagyna (Roxb), D. indica (Linn.) and D. suffruticosa 
(Griffith Ex. Hook. F. & Thomsom Martelli) have been reported to be used to 
treat cancerous growth.
OBJECTIVE: The present review explored and provided information on the 
therapeutic potential of Dillenia species.
METHODS: Comprehensive and relevant literature on the therapeutic potential of 
Dillenia species was gathered through electronic databases including Google 
Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and books, without limiting the dates of publication.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The review demonstrated that only a few Dillenia species 
have been proven scientifically for their therapeutic potential in pre-clinical 
studies, including D. pentagyna, D. indica, D. papuana (Martelli), D. 
meliosmifolia (Hook. F. Ex. Thomsom) and D. suffruticosa (Griffith Ex Hook. F. & 
Thomson). A few species of Dillenia have undergone isolation and 
characterization of compounds with lupeol and betulinic acids having tremendous 
pharmacological potential. Dillenia species warrant further studies on their 
therapeutic potential, which may eventually lead to the development of new drug 
candidates for treatment of various diseases.

Nature is a rich source of natural drug-like compounds with minimal side 
effects. Phytochemicals better known as "Natural Products" are found abundantly 
in a number of plants. Since time immemorial, spices have been widely used in 
Indian cuisine as flavoring and coloring agents. Most of these spices and 
condiments are derived from various biodiversity hotspots in India (which 
contribute 75% of global spice production) and form the crux of India's 
multidiverse and multicultural cuisine. Apart from their aroma, flavor and 
taste, these spices and condiments are known to possess several medicinal 
properties also. Most of these spices are mentioned in the Ayurveda, the 
indigenous system of medicine. The antimicrobial, antioxidant, 
antiproliferative, antihypertensive and antidiabetic properties of several of 
these natural products are well documented in Ayurveda. These phytoconstituemts 
are known to act as functional immunoboosters, immunomodulators as well as 
anti-inflammatory agents. As anticancer agents, their mechanistic action 
involves cancer cell death via induction of apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. 
The present review provides a comprehensive and collective update on the

The present study was designed to evaluate in vitro anti-proliferative potential 
of extracts from four Indian medicinal plants, namely Anogeissus latifolia, 
Terminalia bellerica, Acacia catechu and Moringa oleiferna. Their cytotoxicity 
was tested in nine human cancer cell lines, including cancers of lung (A549), 
prostate (PC-3), breast (T47D and MCF-7), colon (HCT-16 and Colo-205) and 
leukemia (THP-1, HL-60 and K562) by using SRB and MTT assays. The findings 
showed that the selected plant extracts inhibited the cell proliferation of nine 
human cancer cell lines in a concentration dependent manner. The extracts 
inhibited cell viability of leukemia HL-60 and K562 cells by blocking G0/G1 
phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, A. catechu extract at 100 μg/mL induced 
G2/M arrest in K562 cells. DNA fragmentation analysis displayed the appearance 
of a smear pattern of cell necrosis upon agarose gel electrophoresis after 
incubation of HL-60 cells with these extracts for 24 h.

Nicotine and the minor tobacco alkaloids give rise to tobacco-specific 
N-nitrosamines (TSNA) during tobacco processing and during smoking. 
Chemical-analytical studies led to the identification of seven TSNA in smokeless 
tobacco (< or = 25 micrograms/g) and in mainstream smoke of cigarettes (1.3 
micrograms TSNA/cigarette). Indoor air polluted by tobacco smoke may contain up 
to 24 pg/L of TSNA. In mice, rats, and hamsters, three TSNA, 
N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone 
(NNK), and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), are powerful 
carcinogens; two TSNA are moderately active as carcinogens; and two TSNA appear 
not to be carcinogenic. The TSNA are procarcinogens, agents that require 
metabolic activation. The active forms of the carcinogenic TSNA react with 
cellular components, including DNA, and with hemoglobin (Hb). The Hb adducts in 
chewers and smokers serve as biomarkers for the uptake and metabolic activation 
of carcinogenic TSNA and the urinary excretion of NNAL as free alcohol and as 
glucuronide for the uptake of TSNA. The review presents evidence that strongly 
supports the concept that TSNA contribute to the increased risk for cancer of 
the upper digestive tract in tobacco chewers and for the increased risk of lung 
cancer, especially pulmonary adenocarcinoma, in smokers. The high incidence of 
cancer of the upper digestive tract especially among men on the Indian 
subcontinent has been causally associated with chewing of betel quid mixed with 
tobacco. In addition to the TSNA, the betel quid chewers are exposed to four 
N-nitrosamines that are formed during chewing from the Areca alkaloids, two of 
these N-nitrosamines are carcinogens. The article also reviews approaches toward 
the reduction of the carcinogenic potency of smokeless tobacco, betel 
quid-tobacco mixtures, and cigarette smoke. Although the safest way to reduce 
the risk for tobacco-related cancers is to refrain from chewing and smoking, 
modifications of smokeless tobacco and of cigarettes are indicated to lead to 
less toxic products. Another more recent approach for reducing the carcinogenic 
effect of tobacco products is the application of chemopreventive agents, 
primarily of micronutrients. Future aspects in tobacco carcinogenesis, 
especially as it relates to TSNA, are expected in the field of molecular 
biochemistry and in biomarker studies, with the goal of identifying those 
tobacco and betel quid chewers and tobacco smokers who are at especially high 
risk for cancer.

Cancer is a dreadful disease constituting abnormal growth and proliferation of 
malignant cells in the body. Next to lung cancer, breast cancer is the most 
common form of cancer affecting women. The apoptotic pathway regulators, B cell 
lymphoma family of protein, play a key role in various malignancies defining 
cancer and their constitutive expression plays an integral role in breast cancer 
chemotherapy. The research work discusses the identification and molecular 
cloning of a B cell lymphoma like gene from human breast cancer cell line. The 
open reading frame of the gene consisted of 965 nucleotides, encoding a protein 
of 380 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 42.5 kilodalton. The 
predicted physiochemical properties of the gene were as follows: Isoelectric 
point - 9.49, molecular formula - C1893H3004N534O548S16, total number of 
negatively charged residues, (Aspartate+Glutamate) - 26, total number of 
positively charged residues, (Arginine+Lysine)-39, instability index-42.08 
(unstable protein) and grand average of hydropathicity is -0.202. Additionally, 
phobius prediction suggested non-cytoplasmic localization of the putative 
protein. The presence of secondary structure in the protein was determined by 
Memsat program. A 3 dimensional protein homology model was generated using 
threading based method of protein modeling for structural and functional 
annotation of the putative protein. Future prospects accounts for the 
biochemical characterization of the enzyme including in vitro assays on breast 
cancer cell line would establish the functional characteristics of the protein 
and its physiological mechanisms in breast cancer development and its 
therapeutic-target role in future.

Withanolides are a group of pharmacologically active compounds present in most 
prodigal amounts in roots and leaves of Withania somnifera (Indian ginseng), one 
of the most important medicinal plants of Indian traditional practice of 
medicine. Withanolides are steroidal lactones (highly oxygenated C-28 
phytochemicals) and have been reported to exhibit immunomodulatory, anticancer 
and other activities. In the present study, a quantitative structure activity 
relationship (QSAR) model was developed by a forward stepwise multiple linear 
regression method to predict the activity of withanolide analogs against human 
breast cancer. The most effective QSAR model for anticancer activity against the 
SK-Br-3 cell showed the best correlation with activity (r2=0.93 and rCV2 =0.90). 
Similarly, cross-validation regression coefficient (rCV2=0.85) of the best QSAR 
model against the MCF7/BUS cells showed a high correlation (r2=0.91). In 
particular, compounds CID_73621, CID_435144, CID_301751 and CID_3372729 have a 
marked antiproliferative activity against the MCF7/BUS cells, while 
2,3-dihydrowithaferin A-3-beta-O-sulfate, withanolide 5, withanolide A, 
withaferin A, CID_10413139, CID_11294368, CID_53477765, CID_135887, CID_301751 
and CID_3372729 have a high activity against the Sk-Br-3 cells compared to 
standard drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and camptothecin. Molecular docking was 
performed to study the binding conformations and different bonding behaviors, in 
order to reveal the plausible mechanism of action behind higher accumulation of 
active withanolide analogs with β-tubulin. The results of the present study may 
help in the designing of lead compound with improved activity.

The medicinal plant Withania somnifera is widely researched for its 
anti-inflammatory, cardioactive and central nervous system effects. In Ayurveda 
, the major Traditional Indian medicine system, extracts from W. somnifera are 
distinctively employed for the treatment of arthritis and menstrual disorders. 
Because these conditions involve angiogenic processes we hypothesized that the 
W. somnifera extracts might contain angiogenesis inhibitors. We employed an 
endothelial cell-sprouting assay to monitor the purification of substances from 
W. somnifera root extracts and isolated as the active principle the previously 
known natural product withaferin A. We show that withaferin A inhibits human 
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) sprouting in three-dimensional 
collagen-I matrix at doses which are relevant to NF-kappa B-inhibitory activity. 
Withaferin A inhibits cell proliferation in HUVECs (IC50 =12 nM) at doses that 
are significantly lower than those required for tumor cell lines through a 
process associated with inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. We propose that the 
inhibition of NF-kappa B by withaferin A in HUVECs occurs by interference with 
the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway as suggested by the increased levels 
of poly-ubiquitinated proteins. Finally, withaferin A is shown to exert potent 
anti-angiogenic activity in vivo at doses that are 500-fold lower than those 
previously reported to exert anti-tumor activity in vivo. In conclusion, our 
findings identify a novel mode of action of withaferin A, which highlights the 
potential use of this natural product for cancer treatment or prevention.

As part of pharmacological-phytochemical integrated studies on medicinal plants 
from Indian flora, costunolide (1) and dehydrocostus lactone (2), were isolated 
as major phytochemicals from Saussurea lappa, a plant traditionally used in 
different Asian systems of medicine. A series of 
1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazoles conjugates were synthesized through diastereo 
selective Michael addition followed by regioselective Huisgen 1,3-dipolar 
cycloaddition reactions. All these triazolyl derivatives (5a-5j) & (7a-7j) were 
well characterized using modern spectroscopic techniques and evaluated for their 
anticancer activity against a panel of five human cancerous celllines. The 
results indicated that all the analogs displayed moderate cytotoxic activity.

In interviews on the traditional herbal medicines of Tupi-Guarany Indians at the 
herbal market of Asuncion and questionnaire from their users, it was clarified 
that various useful medicinal plants are available in Paraguay and most of them 
are generally used without drying. In the search for bioactive substances from 
those plants, a β-glucuronidase-inhibitory diterpene called scoparic acid A (SA) 
was isolated from Scoparia dulcis L. together with scoparic acid B, scoparic 
acid C, and the aphidicolin-like tetracyclic diterpenes scopadulcic acid A (SDA) 
and scopadulcic acid B (SDB). HPLC analysis of diterpenes in the individual 
plants of Paraguayan and Asian S. dulcis revealed the presence of three 
chemotypes based on major component, i.e., SA type, SDB type, and SDX type 
containing mainly scopadiol and scopadulciol (SDC). SA and SDB were elucidated 
to be mainly biosynthesized in the leaves via 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol- 
4-phosphate pathway, and a leaf organ culture system containing methyl jasmonate 
10 µM was found to enhance the production of diterpenes by activation of 
Ca-signal transduction systems such as calmodulin and protein kinase C. On the 
other hand, SDB and SDC were found to show multifaceted pharmacological effects 
such as inhibitory effects on gastric acid excretion, bone resorption, 
replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), etc. In addition, SDC was 
suggested to be applicable to cancer gene therapy using ganciclovir or acyclovir 
and the HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene called the suicide gene.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Antiplasmodial activity, inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) 
overproduction, and anti-proliferative activity were investigated in vitro to 
evaluate the bioactive potential of the traditional pharmacopoeia of the 
Mascarene Archipelago, which is known for its biodiversity and for the richness 
of its endemic flora.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 45 methanol (MeOH) and dichloromethane (DCM) 
extracts were prepared from 19 plant species collected on Réunion and Mauritius 
Islands. Ninety-six-well microplate assays were performed on chloroquine 
sensitive Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain, on LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 murine 
macrophages and on A-549, DLD-1 and WS1 human cells. Activity was evaluated 
through spectrophotometric methods.
RESULTS: Activity was attributed to plant extracts expressing IC(50)<50μg/ml for 
antiplasmodial response, IC(50)<100μg/ml for cytotoxicity, and IC(50)<130μg/ml 
for anti-inflammatory reaction. The majority of the extracts tested (69%) 
exhibited potency in at least one of these three types of activity. This is the 
first report describing promising antiplasmodial activity (IC(50)<15μg/ml) for 
Psiadia dentata DCM extract and Terminalia bentzoe MeOH bark extract. NO 
inhibition assay revealed seven interesting plants, described for the first time 
as anti-inflammatory: Aphloia theiformis, Buddleja salviifolia, Eupatorium 
riparium, Hiptage benghalensis, Psiadia arguta, Psiadia dentata, and Scutia 
commersonii. Finally, anti-proliferative activity was observed for two endemic 
species, Geniostoma borbonicum and Nuxia verticillata.
CONCLUSION: Using the criterion of endemism as part of the criteria for 
traditional medicinal use raises the chances of finding original active 
principles. In our case, 86% of the endemic plants tested displayed 
pharmacological interest.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Plants have been used in folk medicine by Mayan 
ancient people from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, to treat some diseases 
considered as cancer diseases such as chronic wounds or tumors.
AIM OF THE STUDY: We collected a selection of nine plants in order to 
investigate their cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic extracts were tested for their cytotoxicity 
using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) 
assay on four cancer cell lines; nasopharynx carcinoma (KB), laryngeal carcinoma 
(Hep-2), cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa), and cervix squamous carcinoma cells 
(SiHa) and one normal cell line; canine kidney (MDCK).
RESULTS: All species exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity. The root bark 
extract of Hamelia patens exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity on HeLa cells 
with a CC50 of 13 microg/mL and selectivity index of 13.3, higher than 
docetaxel. Gossypium schottii and Dioon spinulosum showed similar good cytotoxic 
activity and selectivity index on HeLa and Hep-2 cells, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Hamelia patens, Dioon spinulosum and Gossypium schottii 
demonstrated promising cytotoxic activity and have been selected for future 
bio-guided fractionation and isolation of active cytotoxic compounds.

Diallyl sulfide (C6H10S, DAS) is one of the novel natural organosulfur 
compounds, which is mostly obtained from the genus Allium plants. Numerous 
studies have revealed several unique properties of DAS in terms of its 
health-promoting effects. DAS has proved to be anticancer, antimicrobial, 
anti-angiogenic, and immunomodulatory like unique functions as demonstrated by 
the multiple investigations. Diallyl sulfide can also impede oxidative stress 
and chronic inflammation as suggested by the literature. Studies also explored 
that DAS could thwart the development of chronic diseases like cancer, neuronal, 
cardiovascular disease through modulating mechanistic pathways involved in 
pathogenesis. In this book chapter, we have attempted to give the comprehensive 
view on DAS about the physiochemical and biological properties, and its 
preventive role in chronic diseases with a mechanistic overview.

Cytotoxic, Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant Activities of Heliotropium indicum 
Extracts.

Chunthorng-Orn J, Dechayont B, Phuaklee P, Prajuabjinda O, Juckmeta T, Itharat 
A.

BACKGROUND: Heliotropium indicum Linn., or ‘Indian heliotrope’ is very common in 
India with a long history of traditional medicinal uses in many countries in the 
world. In Thailand, the plant has been traditionally use to cure various 
diseases such as fever, insect bites, stings, diarrhea, skin rashes, menstrual 
disorder and urticaria. In addition, the plant is commonly used by Thai folk 
doctors as a component in remedies for treatment of lung cancer.
OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated cytotoxicity against two types 
of lung cancer cell lines (A549 and NCI-H226), anti-inflammatory effect and 
antioxidant activity of Heliotropium indicum extracts.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The water and ethanolic extracts of Heliotropium indicum 
were tested. The cytotoxic activity against two types of human lung cancer cell 
lines (A549 and NCI-H226) was evaluated by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. The 
antiinflammatory effect was investigated on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated 
RAW 264.7 macrophages. LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production was determined 
by Griess reagent. The antioxidant activity was performed by 1, 
1-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method.
RESULTS: The ethanolic extract showed cytotoxic activity only against NCI-H226 
(IC50 = 51.90±2.35 μg/ml) whereas the water extract had no cytotoxic activity 
against both A549 and NCI-H226 (IC50 >100 μg/ml). For anti-inflammatory effect, 
the results revealed that the ethanolic extract exhibited the most potent 
inhibitory activity on nitric oxide production (IC50 = 24.17±2.12 μg/ml), 
followed by Indomethacin (positive control) with an IC50 value of 34.67±6.23 
μg/ml while water extract was apparently inactive (IC50 >100 μg/ml). For 
antioxidant activity, the ethanolic extract showed high antioxidant activity 
(EC50 = 28.91±4.26 μg/ml) but the water extract showed no antioxidant activity 
(EC50 >100 μg/ml).
CONCLUSION: These results can support using Heliotropium indicum Linn. for 
component in lung cancer remedy by Thai folk doctors. However, more studies are 
required.

Medicinal plants are considered as one of the ideal sources for cancer therapy 
due to their bioactive contents and low toxicity to humans. Vernonia genus is 
one of the common medicinal plants, which has wide spread usage in food and 
medicine. However, there are limited studies to explore its anticancer 
properties. In the current study, we have used Vernonia condensata, to explore 
its anticancer activity using various approaches. Here, we show that extract 
prepared from Vernonia condensata (VCE) exhibits cytotoxic properties against 
various cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, when 
treated with VCE, there was no significant cytotoxicity in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that although VCE 
induced cell death, arrest was not observed. VCE treatment led to disruption of 
mitochondrial membrane potential in a concentration dependent manner resulting 
in activation of apoptosis culminating in cell death. Immunoblotting studies 
revealed that VCE activated intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. More importantly, 
VCE treatment resulted in tumor regression leading to significant enhancement in 
life span in treated mice, without showing any detectable side effects. 
Therefore, for the first time our study reveals the potential of extract from 
Vernonia condensata to be used as an anticancer agent.

The present study explores the fungal endophytes from selected high value 
medicinal plants to check their activities at in-vitro and in-vivo level. The 
in-vitro cytotoxicity of selected endophytes revealed potent growth inhibition 
against human cancer cell lines of leukemia (THP-1), lung (A549), prostate 
(PC-3), colon (Caco-2), neuroblastoma (IMR-32) and breast (MCF-7) at a 
concentration of 100 µg/ml. Among them the endophytic strains I. e., IIIM2, 
IIIM3, IIIM7 and IIIM8 showed most significant growth inhibition against colon 
(Caco-2), prostate (PC-3), lung (A549) and leukemia (THP-1) cancer cell lines. 
At the in-vivo level maximum (58.95%) tumor growth inhibition was documented 
with the extract of IIIM2 against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma mouse modal. All the 
potent fungal endophytic strains were characterized using ITS 4 and ITS 5 region 
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was ascertained among them. This paper 
confirms the 2 elite endophytic fungal strains, IIIM2 and IIIM8, have the 
potential to act as a source of new anticancer compounds.

Seventeen endophytic fungi were isolated from various tissues of Cassia fistula 
and the ethyl acetate extracts obtained from 21-day cultures of all the 
endophytic fungal isolates were initially screened for their cytotoxicity 
against HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells using MTT assay. Of these, 
Penicillium sclerotiorum extract (PSE), significantly affected the viability of 
HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner. The extract of P. Sclerotiorum was 
further analyzed by GC-MS, which showed three compounds, hexadecanoic acid, 
oleic acid and benzoic acid to be the major active principles in the 
extracts.The extract was further tested for invitro cytotoxicity against five 
cancer cell lines. Of the cell lines tested, HeLa cells showed maximum 
sensitivity followed by A549, while A431 and U251 were moderately sensitive and 
MCF-7 was insensitive to the treatment. In addition, normal human embryonic 
kidney cells, HEK293 remained insensitive to the treatment. Furthermore, the 
mechanism of cytotoxic activity exhibited by PSE was investigated by evaluating 
cell cycle progression and apoptotic induction in HeLa cells. Cell cycle 
analysis revealed that the PSE arrested cells at S and G2/M phase of the cell 
cycle in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin V- Propidium iodide double staining 
showed that, the extract potentiates apoptosis rather than necrosis in cells. 
This was supported by the down regulation in the proapoptotic protein BCL2 and 
up regulation of BAX (BCL2 Associated X), tumor suppressor protein, p53 and 
Apaf-1 [Apoptotic Peptidase Activating Factor 1]. Loss of mitochondrial membrane 
potential and a distinct DNA fragmentation pattern observed following the 
treatment, suggest that the PSE treatment leads to activation of mitochondrial 
pathway of apoptosis. Further, the extract also exhibited both antioxidant and 
anti-angiogenic properties. These results indicate that endophytic fungi 
isolated from medicinal plants may serve as potential sources of the 
anti-cancerous compounds.

School, NSW.

Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) affects an estimated 2.5 million people, mostly in 
the Indian subcontinent. Limitation of oral opening resulting in difficulty in 
eating is the main presenting feature. Although nutritional deficiencies and 
immunological processes may play a part in the pathogenesis, the available 
epidemiological evidence indicates that chewing betel quid (containing areca 
nut, tobacco, slaked lime or other species) is an important risk factor for OSF. 
Genetically determined susceptibility could explain why only a small fraction of 
those using betel quid develop the disease. In OSF there is an incidence of oral 
cancer of 7.6 per cent for a median 10-year follow-up period. Risk markers for 
malignant transformation in OSF include epithelial dysplasia, silver binding 
nucleolar organizer region counts, and sister-chromatid exchange frequencies; 
p53 tumour suppressor gene mutations may be involved in these potentially 
malignant changes.

Beyond reverse pharmacology: Mechanism-based screening of Ayurvedic drugs.

This paper reviews the pharmacology of Indian medicinal plants, starting with 
the historical background of European work on the subject beginning as early as 
the 17th century, and tracing its history through the work of Sen and Bose in 
the 1930's, and Vakhil's historic 1949 paper on Sarpaghanda. The often crucial 
role of patient feedback in early discoveries is highlighted, as is the time lag 
between proof of pharmacological action and identification of the active 
principle, and subsequent elucidation of mechanism of action. In the case of 
Indian plants in the 20th century this process sometimes took almost 50 years. 
Reserpine and its mechanisms are given in detail, and its current relevance to 
public health discussed. The foundation of present day methods of pharmacology 
is briefly presented so the complexity of methods used to identify properties of 
Ayurveda derived drugs like forskolin and baicalein, and their bioavailability, 
may be better appreciated. Ayurveda derived anti-oxidants and their levels of 
action, immuno-modulators, particularly with respect to the NF-kB pathway and 
its implications for cancer control, are all considered. The example of curcumin 
derived from turmeric is explained in more detail, because of its role in cancer 
prevention. Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of Ayurveda's concepts 
of rasayana as a form of dietary chemo-prevention; the significance of ahar, 
diet, in Ayurveda's aspiration to prevent disease and restore health thus 
becomes clear. Understood in this light, Ayurveda may transcend pharmacology as 
a treatment paradigm.

Curcumin possesses an attractive chemical structure with highly conjugated 
diferuloylmethane core. Curcumin mimics have been designed and prepared with an 
additional bridged phenyl ring in conjugation. Fourteen diverse analogues were 
evaluated against a panel of human cancer cell lines. The best analogue of the 
series i.e. compound 6a exhibited potent cytotoxicity against A431, epidermoid 
carcinoma cell line (IC50 = 1.5 μM) and DLD1, colorectal adenocarcinoma cell 
line (IC50 = 6.9 μM). In tubulin kinetics experiment, compound 6a destabilized 
polymerisation process (IC50 = 4.68 μM). In cell cycle analysis, compound 6a 
exerted G2/M phase arrest in A431 cells and induced apoptosis. In Ehrlich 
Ascites Carcinoma in Swiss-albino mice, compound 6a showed 78.6% tumour 
reduction at 80 mg/kg dose and 57% solid tumour reduction at 150 mg/kg dose. 
Further, in acute-oral toxicity experiment in rodent model, compound 6a was 
given in three different oral doses to Swiss albino mice. There were 
non-significant changes in various biochemical parameters and major body organs 
studied, including their absolute and relative weights. It was tolerable up to 
300 mg/kg dose in Swiss-albino mice. The present study shows that the novel 
curcumin mimic 6a is a safe and efficacious anticancer compound. However, it 
needs to be optimized for better efficacy.

The use of natural products with therapeutic properties is as ancient as human 
civilization and for a long time mineral, plant and animal products were the 
main sources of drugs. Worldwide sales of medicinal plants, crude extracts and 
finished products amounted to US$15 billion in 1999 and it increased to $23 
billion in 2002. More interestingly, the influence of natural products upon 
anticancer drug discovery and design cannot be underestimated. Approximately 60% 
of all drugs in clinical trials are either a natural product, compounds derived 
from natural products or contain pharmacophores derived from active natural 
products. Thus, even today, in the presence of massive numbers of agents from 
combinatorial libraries, compounds from natural sources are still in the 
forefront of cancer chemotherapeutics as sources of active drug types, as well 
as being involved in drug discovery in diseases such as microbial and parasitic 
infections and the control of cholesterol/lipids, among other functions.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Herbal drugs are gaining worldwide prominence 
due to their distinct advantages. Developing countries have started exploring 
the ethnopharmacological approach of drug discovery and have begun to file 
patents on herbal drugs. The expansion of R&D in Indian herbal research 
organizations and presence of manufacturing units at non-Indian sites is an 
indication of the capability to develop new products and processes. The present 
study attempts to identify innovations in the Indian herbal drug sector by 
analyzing the patenting trends in India, US and EU.
METHODOLOGY: Based on key word and IPC based search at the IPO, USPTO, Esp@cenet 
and WIPO databases, patent applications and grant in herbal drugs by Indian 
applicants/assignees was collected for the last ten years (from 1st January 2001 
to 31st October 2010). From this collection patents related to human therapeutic 
use only were selected. Analysis was performed to identify filing trends, major 
applicants/assignees, disease area and major plant species used for various 
treatments.
RESULT: There is a gradual increase in patent filing through the years. In 
India, individual inventors have maximum applications and grants. CSIR, among 
research organizations and Hindustan Unilever, Avesthagen, Piramal Life Science, 
Sahajanand Biotech and Indus Biotech among the companies have the maximum 
granted patents in India, US and EU respectively. Diabetes, cancer and 
inflammatory disorders are the major areas for patenting in India and abroad. 
Recent patents are on new herbal formulations for treatment of AIDS, hepatitis, 
skin disorders and gastrointestinal disorders.
CONCLUSION: A majority of the herbal patents applications and grants in India 
are with individual inventors. Claim analysis indicates that these patents 
include novel multi-herb compositions with synergistic action. Indian research 
organizations are more active than companies in filing for patents. CSIR has 
maximum numbers of applications not only in India but also in the US and EU. 
Patents by research organizations and herbal companies are on development of new 
processes for active compound isolation and standardization of such components 
in addition to new compositions for therapeutic use. Pharmaceutical companies 
such as Ranbaxy, Lupin and Panacea Biotec are increasingly patenting on herbal 
drugs. There is increased patenting activity related to diabetes, cancer, 
cardiovascular diseases, asthma and arthritis in India and abroad.

Experimental activity of a compound on cancer cell line/target is mostly 
analyzed in the form of percentage inhibition at different concentration 
gradient and time of incubation. In this study a statistical model has been 
developed referred as in silico assay using support vector regression model, 
which can act with change in concentration gradient and time of incubation. This 
model is a function of concentration gradient, treatment hour and independent 
components; which calculate the percentage inhibition in combination of above 
three components. This model is designed to screen tetracyclic triterpenoids 
active against human breast cancer cell line MCF7. The model has been 
statistically validated, checked for applicability domain and predicted results 
were reconfirmed by MTT assay, for example Oenotheranstrol derivatives, OenA & 
B. Computational SAR, target and docking studies were performed to understand 
the cytotoxic mechanism of action of Oenotheranstrol compounds. The proposed in 
silico assay model will work for specific chemical family for which it will be 
optimized. This model can be used to analyze growth kinetics pattern on 
different human cancer cell lines for designed compounds.

Wnt signaling is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, 
differentiation and apoptosis. Its aberrant activation is a key event in the 
pathogenesis and progression of human colorectal cancers. Dietary phytochemicals 
are gaining importance as chemotherapeutic agents owing to their potential to 
prevent, delay or reverse oncogenesis. Here we demonstrate that emodin 
(1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone), an anthraquinone present in the roots 
and bark of several medicinal plants, down regulates Wnt signaling pathway in 
human colorectal cancer cells (SW480 and SW620) by down regulating TCF/LEF 
transcriptional activity. Emodin significantly down regulated the expression of 
key players of Wnt signaling (β-catenin and TCF7L2) and also that of its various 
downstream targets (cyclin D1, c-Myc, snail, vimentin, MMP-2 and MMP-9). Two 
novel targets of emodin׳s action were discovered namely Wnt co-activator p300 
(down regulated) and repressor HBP1 (up regulated). Morphological changes 
induced by emodin suggest mesenchymal to epithelial transition accompanied by 
the increase in E-cadherin expression in human colorectal cancer cells but a 
differentiation marker (alkaline phosphatase) was activated only in SW620 cells 
(metastatic origin) and not in SW480 cells (primary tumor-derived). Moreover, 
our data indicate that reactive oxygen species plays a key role in 
emodin-mediated down regulation of Wnt signaling as emodin-mediated inhibition 
of migration and induction of growth arrest were partially rescued by the 
reactive oxygen species scavenger ascorbic acid. Effects of emodin shown in this 
study may provide important insights for the use of this anthraquinone as a 
potential complementary and integrated medicine for the treatment of human 
colorectal cancer.

Cancer is a global health problem and chemoprevention is a promising approach 
for reducing cancer burden. Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), a natural bioactive 
constituent of cereals, legumes, etc., has momentous potential as an 
antiangiogenic agent, that specifically affects malignant cells. The shortcoming 
is its quick absorption on oral/topical administration. Niosomes are flexible 
carriers for topical drug delivery. The central venture of current research was 
to optimize and characterize niosomal delivery system of IP6 for treatment of 
skin cancer. Thin film hydration method was utilized to prepare IP6 niosomes, 
and these were dispersed as a suspension in a suitable base. Developed 
formulations were analyzed for various physicochemical and pharmacological 
parameters such as particle size, encapsulation efficiency, morphology, drug 
release, texture analysis, irritability, cell line studies, Western blotting, 
RT-PCR, and histopathology. IP6 niosomal suspension and IP6 in acetone displayed 
IC50 value at the concentration of 0.96 mM (0.63 mg/mL) and 1.39 mM (0.92 
mg/mL), respectively. IP6 niosomal suspension showed significantly higher (p < 
0.05) activity and showed cytotoxic effect in SK-MEL-2 cancer cell line. Crucial 
events of cellular proliferation and differentiation, like expression of 
ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), 
cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Cyclin D1 were initiated from the fourth hour 
through application of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) on albino mice. The 
DMBA altered expression of aforesaid enzymes was significantly (P < 0.001) 
prevented by concomitant application of niosomal formulations. Results of cell 
line study, Western blotting, RT-PCR, and histopathology suggested that IP6 
niosomal suspension could constitute a promising approach for prevention of 
cellular proliferation as well as DMBA induced dysregulation of cellular 
proliferation/differentiation and inflammation.

Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) is one of the most versatile medicinal plants, 
widely distributed in the Indian subcontinent. Neem is a rich source of 
limonoids that are endowed with potent medicinal properties predominantly 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. Azadirachtin, 
gedunin, and nimbolide are more extensively investigated relative to other neem 
limonoids. Accumulating evidence indicates that the anticancer effects of neem 
limonoids are mediated through the inhibition of hallmark capabilities of cancer 
such as cell proliferation, apoptosis evasion, inflammation, invasion, and 
angiogenesis. The neem limonoids have been demonstrated to target oncogenic 
signaling kinases and transcription factors chiefly, NF-κB, Wnt/β-catenin, 
PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Neem limonoids that target 
multiple pathways that are aberrant in cancer are ideal candidates for cancer 
chemoprevention and therapy.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major worldwide health problem, causing 
chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and primary liver cancer (Hepatocellular 
carcinoma). HCV encodes a precursor polyprotein that is enzymatically cleaved to 
release the individual viral proteins. The viral non-structural proteins are 
cleaved by the HCV NS3 serine protease. NS3 is regarded currently as a potential 
target for anti-viral drugs thus specific inhibitors of its enzymatic activity 
should be of importance. A prime requisite for detailed biochemical studies of 
the protease and its potential inhibitors is the availability of a rapid 
reliable in vitro assay of enzyme activity. A novel assay for measurement of HCV 
NS3 serine protease activity was developed for screening of HCV NS3 serine 
protease potential inhibitors. Recombinant NS3 serine protease was isolated and 
purified, and a fluorometric assay for NS3 proteolytic activity was developed. 
As an NS3 substrate we engineered a recombinant fusion protein where a green 
fluorescent protein is linked to a cellulose-binding domain via the NS5A/B site 
that is cleavable by NS3. Cleavage of this substrate by NS3 results in emission 
of fluorescent light that is easily detected and quantitated by fluorometry. 
Using our system we identified NS3 serine protease inhibitors from extracts 
obtained from natural Indian Siddha medicinal plants. Our unique fluorometric 
assay is very sensitive and has a high throughput capacity making it suitable 
for screening of potential NS3 serine protease inhibitors.

Oleo gum resin secreted by Commiphora mukul, also known as gum guggul, has been 
used widely as an ayurvedic drug. Commiphora mukul is a short thorny shrub that 
is native to the Indian subcontinent. Oleo gum resin extracted by incision of 
the bark is a very complex mixture of gum, minerals, essential oils, terpenes, 
sterols, ferrulates, flavanones and sterones. Its active constituents, the Z- 
and E-guggulsterones, have been demonstrated to exhibit their biological 
activities by binding to nuclear receptors and modulating the expression of 
proteins involved in carcinogenic activities. Guggulsterones have also been 
reported to regulate gene expression by exhibiting control over other molecular 
targets including transcription factors such as nuclear factor (NF)-κB, signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and steroid receptors. 
Considerable scientific evidence indicates the use of gum guggul as a 
therapeutic agent in the treatment of inflammation, nervous disorders, 
hyperlipidaemia and associated cardiac disorders such as hypertension and 
ischaemia, skin disorders, cancer and urinary disorders. This review highlights 
the taxonomic details, phytochemical properties and pharmacological profile of

A series of novel chalcone-triazole derivatives were synthesized and screened 
for in vitro anticancer activity on the human cancer cell lines IMR32 
(neuroblastoma), HepG2 (hepatoma) and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), DU-145 
(prostate carcinoma), and A549 (lung adenocarcinoma). Among the tested 
compounds, 4r showed the most promising anticancer activity in all the cell 
lines whereas, compounds 4c (IC50 65.86 μM), 4e (IC50 66.28 μM), 4o (IC50 
35.81 μM), 4q (IC50 50.82 μM) and 4s (IC50 48.63 μM) showed better activity than 
the standard doxorubicin (IC50 69.33 μM) in A549 cell line alone. Rat intestinal 
α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the synthesized derivatives showed 4m (IC50 
67.77 μM), 4p (IC50 74.94 in μM) and 4s (IC50 102.10 μM) as most active compared 
to others. The in silico docking of synthesized derivatives 4a-4t with DNA 
topoisomerase IIα revealed the LibDock score in the range of 71.2623-118.29 
whereas, compounds 4h, 4m, 4p and 4s with docking target α-glucosidase were in 
the range of 100.372-107.784.

A new series of monomer and dimer derivatives of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) 
containing substituted chalcones as a linker were synthesized and investigated 
for their cytotoxicity in human cancer cell lines HL-60 (leukemia), Mia PaCa-2 
(pancreatic cancer), PC-3 (prostate cancer), LS180 (colon cancer) and HEPG2 
(hepatocellular carcinoma). Some of these derivatives have greater 
antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in tested cell lines than parent 
compound DHA. The structures of the all compounds were confirmed by IR, (1)H NMR 
and mass spectral data. Among the new derivatives, compounds 8, 14, 15, 20 and 
24 were found to be more active than parent DHA against tested human cancer cell 
lines. DHA derivatives were found to be most active in human leukemia cell lines 
with compounds 8, 14, 15, 20 and 24 showed IC50 values less than 1 μM for 48 h 
whereas DHA has IC50 value of 2 μM at same time period. The most potent 
compounds 8 with IC50 = 0.3 μM (at par with doxorubicin (IC50 = 0.3 μM)) and 15 
with IC50 = 0.4 μM, of the series, six and three times active than DHA (with 
IC50 = 2 μM) respectively were selected for further mechanistic work in human 
leukemia HL-60 cells.

The mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the flavivirus genus of the 
Flaviviridae family. Contemporary epidemic strains of ZIKV are associated with 
congenital malformations in infants, including microcephaly, as well as 
Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. A risk of human-to-human transmission of ZIKV 
is also well documented. A worldwide research effort has been undertaken to 
identify safe and effective strategies to prevent or treat ZIKV infection. We 
show here that extract from Aphloia theiformis, an edible endemic plant from 
Indian Ocean islands, exerts a potent antiviral effect against ZIKV strains of 
African and Asian lineages, including epidemic strains. The antiviral effect of 
A. theiformis extract was extended to clinical isolates of dengue virus (DENV) 
of the four serotypes in human hepatocytes. A. theiformis inhibited virus entry 
in host cells by acting directly on viral particles, thus impairing their 
attachment to the cell surface. Electron microscopic observations revealed that 
organization of ZIKV particles was severely affected by A. theiformis. We 
propose a model of antiviral action for A. theiformis against flaviviruses that 
highlights the potential of medicinal plants as promising sources of 
naturally-derived antiviral compounds to prevent ZIKV and DENV infections.

Benzylidene indanones have been designed and synthesized from gallic acid, a 
plant phenolic acid as possible anticancer agent. The best analogue of the 
series, that is, 
3-(3',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-4,5,6-trimethoxy-2-(4˝-nitrobenzylidene)-indan-1-one 
(8) exhibited potent cytotoxicity (IC50 =3-10 μm) against several human cancer 
cell lines through microtubule destabilization (IC50 =1.54 μm) after occupying 
colchicine-binding site of β-tubulin. In cell cycle analysis, compound 8 exerted 
G2/M phase arrest in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and induced apoptosis. It 
reduced 34.8% solid tumor in in vivo Ehrlich ascite carcinoma in Swiss albino 
mice at 30 mg/kg dose. In acute oral toxicity experiment, it was tolerable up to 
300 mg/kg doses in Swiss albino mice. The lead compound 8 needs to be optimized 
for better activity.

Due to the increased use of ionizing radiation in various aspects of human life 
especially in areas pertaining to radiotherapy of cancer, food preservation, 
agriculture, industry and power generation, there is a need to develop an 
effective and non-toxic radioprotector. The currently available ones have many 
drawbacks including high cost, side effects and toxicity. Several novel 
approaches are on to locate a potent radioprotector. These include mimics of 
antioxidant enzymes, nitroxides, melatonin, growth factors, gene therapy, 
hyperthermia apart from natural products. The latter has several advantages 
since they are non-toxic with proven therapeutic benefits. These can be 
classified as natural compounds and plant extracts; polyherbal formulations; 
besides natural and semi-natural compounds of plant origin. A review of the 
above agents, their efficacy in radioprotection and possible mechanisms 
responsible has been carried out. As India and many Eastern countries have an 
enormous heritage of vast natural dietary and time tested medicinal resources it 
is worth exploring the possibility of developing efficient, economically viable 
and clinically acceptable radioprotectors for human application from these 
resources.

Ethnomedicinal knowledge of plant-derived bioactives could help us in 
discovering new therapeutic compounds of great potential. Certainly, dandelion 
has been used in traditional ethno-medicinal systems (i.e., Chinese, Arabian, 
Indian, and Native American) to treat different types of cancer. Though, 
dandelion is highly vigorous, but the potential mode of action is still unclear. 
In the current study, the antiproliferative activity of methanolic extracts of 
dandelion root (MEDr) on cell viability of HepG2, MCF7, HCT116, and normal Hs27 
was investigated. It was observed that MEDr (500 μg/mL) drastically decreased 
the growth of HepG2 cell line, while the effect on MCF7 and HCT116 cell lines 
was less pronounced and no effect has been observed in Hs27 cell lines. The MEDr 
also enhanced the phosphorylation level of AMPK of HepG2 cells, which considered 
crucial in cancer treatment and other metabolic diseases. The AMPK activation by 
MEDr noticed in the current study has never been reported previously. The 
results regarding the number of apoptotic cells (HepG2 cells) were in line with 
the cell viability test. The current observations clearly demonstrated the 
potency of MEDr against liver cancer with validation that dandelion could 
control AMPK and thus cancer in the treated cell lines.

Although a number of chemicals have been isolated from Terminalia arjuna, only a 
few have been evaluated for their biological significance. As a part of our drug 
discovery programme for cytotoxic agents from Indian medicinal plants, four 
novel cytotoxic agents arjunic acid (1), arjungenin (2), arjunetin (3) and 
arjunoglucoside I (4) were isolated from the bark of T. ARJUNA. Out of the four 
compounds, arjunic acid (1) was significantly active against the human oral 
(KB), ovarian (PA 1) and liver (HepG-2 & WRL-68) cancer cell lines. Further, the 
most active compound arjunic acid was converted into seven semi-synthetic ester 
derivatives 5 - 11. 2-O-Palmitoyl arjunic acid (6) showed two times more 
activity, while 2, 3-di-O-acetyl-, 2-O-p-anisoyl-, 2, 3-di-O-benzoyl- and 2, 
3-di-O-p-nitrobenzoyl arjunic acid (7 - 10) showed 1.7 - 2.3 times less activity 
than the cytotoxic drug vinblastine against the liver cancer cell lines HepG-2 
and WRL-68 respectively.

Herbal remedies are clearly a complementary and alternative modality used 
frequently by patients with hemato-oncological neoplasias during the course of 
their specific treatment. This review focuses on the potential safety and 
efficacy of herbs which are either used often or even on a daily basis by 
patients with hematological malignancies or indicated in the herbal 
pharmacopeias utilized by various traditional systems of medicine, in order to 
improve the well-being of patients with these cancers. Traditional medicine 
worldwide is a source for ongoing laboratory research related to the activity of 
herbs on cultured cell lines derived from patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and 
myeloma. Although the number of clinical studies in the field of hemato-oncology 
is limited, there appears to be potential efficacy in studies of mistletoe 
(Viscum album), green tea, Indian and Middle-Eastern spices, and some 
traditional Chinese, American, and European herbs. In addition to the potential 
efficacy of herbs, safety issues are also reviewed here, particularly, the 
documented and potential side effects, herb-drug interactions, and matters of 
quality control. Based on the above issues, the authors suggest enhancing 
doctor-patient communication regarding herbal use by adopting a patient-centered 
attitude based on scientific perspective.

Induction of premature senescence represents a novel functional strategy to curb 
the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant cancer cells. This study unveils the 
regiospecific synthesis of novel isoxazoline derivatives condensed to ring A of 
medicinal plant product Withaferin-A. Intriguingly, the cis fused products with 
β-oriented hydrogen exhibited excellent cytotoxic activities against 
proliferating human breast cancer MCF7 and colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells. The 
most potent derivative W-2b triggered premature senescence along with increase 
in senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and 
induction of senescence-specific marker p21Waf1/Cip1 at its sub-toxic 
concentration. W-2b conferred a robust increase in phosphorylation of mammalian 
checkpoint kinase-2 (Chk2) in cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Silencing 
of endogenous Chk2 by siRNA divulged that the amplification of p21 expression 
and senescence by W-2b was Chk2-dependent. Chk2 activation (either by ectopic 
overexpression or through treatment with W-2b) suppressed NM23-H1 signaling axis 
involved in cancer cell proliferation. Finally, W-2b showed excellent in vivo 
efficacy with 83.8% inhibition of tumor growth at a dose of 25 mg/kg, b.w. in 
mouse mammary carcinoma model. Our study claims that W-2b could be a potential 
candidate to limit aberrant cellular proliferation rendering promising 
improvement in the treatment regime in cancer patients.

Here, we provide evidences that natural product derivative 3-azido Withaferin A 
(3-AWA) abrogated EMT and invasion by modulating β-catenin localization and its 
transcriptional activity in the prostate as well as in breast cancer cells. This 
study, for the first time, reveals 3-AWA treatment consistently sequestered 
nuclear β-catenin and augmented its cytoplasmic pool as evidenced by reducing 
β-catenin transcriptional activity in these cells. Moreover, 3-AWA treatment 
triggered robust induction of pro-apoptotic intracellular Par-4, attenuated Akt 
activity and rescued Phospho-GSK3β (by Akt) to promote β-catenin 
destabilization. Further, our in vitro studies demonstrate that 3-AWA treatment 
amplified E-cadherin expression along with sharp downregulation of c-Myc and 
cyclin D1 proteins. Strikingly, endogenous Par-4 knock down by siRNA underscored 
3-AWA mediated inhibition of nuclear β-catenin was Par-4 dependent and 
suppression of Par-4 activity, either by Bcl-2 or by Ras transfection, restored 
the nuclear β-catenin level suggesting Par-4 mediated β-catenin regulation was 
not promiscuous. In vivo results further demonstrated that 3-AWA was effective 
inhibitor of tumor growth and immunohistochemical studies indicated that 
increased expression of total β-catenin and decreased expression of 
phospho-β-catenin and Par-4 in breast cancer tissues as compared to normal 
breast tissue suggesting Par-4 and β-catenin proteins are mutually regulated and 
inversely co-related in normal as well as cancer condition. Thus, strategic 
regulation of intracellular Par-4 by 3-AWA in diverse cancers could be an 
effective tool to control cancer cell metastasis. Conclusively, this report puts 
forward a novel approach of controlling deregulated β-catenin signaling by 3-AWA 
induced Par-4 protein.

INTRODUCTION: Moringa oleifera (MO) is an important dietary component for many 
populations in West Africa and the Indian subcontinent. In addition to its 
highly nutritious value, almost all parts of this plant have been widely used in 
folk medicine in curing infectious, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, 
and other diseases. Evidence-based research supported its versatile medicinal 
properties; however, more rigorous research is required to establish it in 
cancer therapy. As such, in this study we aim to investigate the in vitro 
anticancerous effect of Moringa oleifera's aqueous leaf extract.
METHODS: Moringa extract was prepared by soaking pulverized leaves in hot water 
mimicking the people's mode of the leaf drink preparation. Several assays were 
used to study the effect of different percentage concentrations of the extract 
on viability of A549 cells; levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione (GSH) generated; as well as percentage of 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released at different time points. In addition to 
mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptotic events were assessed using western 
blotting for apoptotic markers and immunoflourescent flourescent labeled 
inhibitor of caspases (FLICA) assay.
RESULTS: MO extract treatment resulted in a significant decrease in 
mitochondrial membrane potential (1 hour) and ATP levels (3 hours), followed by 
an increase in (6 hours) ROS, caspase activation, proapoptotic proteins 
expression (p53, SMAC/Diablo, AIF), and PARP-1 cleavage. This eventually 
resulted in decreased GSH levels and a decrease in viability. The cytotoxic 
effect was prevented upon pretreatment with antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. MO 
decreased as well the viability of HepG2, CaCo2, Jurkat, and HEK293 cells.
CONCLUSION: Our findings identify a plant extract with an anticancerous effect 
on cancer cell lines. MO extract exerts its cytotoxic effect in A549 cancer 
cells by affecting mitochondrial viability and inducing apoptosis in an 
ROS-dependent manner.

Areca nut: a review.

Arjungi KN.

Areca cattechu Linn is commonly known as areca nut or betel nut. It is a very 
widely cultivated plant in eastern countries like India, Bangladesh, Ceylon, 
Malaya, the Philippines and Japan. The importance of this nut is due to its use 
for chewing purposes. It had an important place as a pharmaceutical in 
Ayurveda--the ancient Indian system of medicine--also in the Chinese medicinal 
practices. The pharmaceutical importance of areca nut is due to the presence of 
an alkaloid, arecoline. Synthetic arecoline hydrobromide is also shown to 
possess numerous pharmacological properties. Chewing of "betel quid" or areca 
nut is a typical oriental habit. Betel quid comprises betel leaf, areca nut, 
catechu, lime and sometimes also tobacco. It is shown that there exists a 
correlationship between betel quid or areca nut chewing habit and oral cancer. A 
number of investigators have been able to produce cellular changes such as 
leukoplakia by application of betel quid or areca nut extract to the buccal 
mucosa of different animal.

A simple and efficient method for the selective synthesis of 2-pyrdones from 
4H-pyrans using iodine as catalyst and ethanol as solvent was developed. The 
present method is equally effective for both aromatic and hetero aromatic ring 
containing 4H-pyrans. The compatibility with various functional groups, mild 
reaction conditions, high yields and application of inexpensive, readily and 
easily available iodine as catalyst and formation of 2-pyridones as major 
products are the advantages of the present procedure. In vitro antiproliferative 
activity of the final synthesized compounds was evaluated with four different 
human cancer cell lines (Lung adenocarcinoma-A549, Hepatocarcinoma-HepG2, Breast 
carcinoma-MCF-7 and Ovarian carcinoma-SKOV3) and normal human lung fibroblast 
cell line (MRC-5). Compounds 2b showed better inhibition against MCF-7, HepG2 
and A549 cell lines (IC50 8.00 ± 0.11, 11.93 ± 0.01 and 15.85 ± 0.04 μM, 
respectively) as compared with doxorubicin and also 2e showed moderate 
inhibition against MCF-7, HepG2 (IC50 9.32 ± 0.21 and 20.22 ± 0.01 μM, 
respectively, cell lines, respectively) as compared with doxorubicin. As many 
clinically used antiproliferative agents induce apoptosis in cancer cells hence, 
the 2-pyridone analogues were also tested for their ability to induce apoptosis 
in MCF-7 cells using the caspases-3 and -9 assays.

Withaferin A, a steroidal lactone isolated from the roots of the Indian 
medicinal plant Withania somnifera, reduced survival of V79 cells in a 
dose-dependent manner. LD50 for survival was 16 microM. One-hour treatment with 
a non-toxic dose of 2.1 microM before irradiation significantly enhanced cell 
killing, giving a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.5 for 37% survival and 
1.4 for 10% survival. SER increased with drug dose, but at higher doses the 
increased lethality appears to be due to two effects-- drug toxicity and 
radiosensitization. The drug induced a G2/M block, with a maximum accumulation 
of cells in G2-M phase at 4 h after treatment with 10.5 microM withaferin A in 1 
h. The applicability of this drug as a radiosensitizer in cancer therapy needs 
to be explored.

Cancer is still considered a "hopeless case", besides all of the advancements in 
oncology research. On the other hand, the natural products, as effective lead 
molecules, have gained significant interest for research due to the absence of 
toxic and harmful side effects usually associated with conventional treatment 
methods. Medicinal properties of herbal plants are strongly evidenced in 
traditional medicine from ancient times. In the context above, withaferin A (WA) 
was identified as the active principle of the plant Withania somnifera, its 
molecule being reported to have excellent anticancer and tumour inhibition 
activities in various cell lines. Furthermore, the in silico approaches in the 
medicinal chemistry of WA revealed the biological targets and gave momentum for 
the research that leads to many amazing pharmacological activities of WA which 
are not yet explored. This includes a broad spectrum of anticancer actions 
manifested in different organs (breast, pancreas, colon), melanoma and B cell 
lymphoma, etc. This review is an extensive survey of the most recent anticancer 
studies reported for WA, along with its mechanism of action and details about 
its in vitro and/or in vivo behaviour.

Medicinal plants proved to be a rich source in exploring a variety of lead 
structures in the development of new drugs. The natural curcuminoids have gained 
considerable attention in recent years for their multiple beneficial 
pharmacological and biological activities. Clinical application of these 
curcuminoids is often impaired due to their poor water solubility, resulting in 
low in vivo bioavailability of the active compound in humans. The objective of 
the present study is to synthesize glucosyl conjugates of curcumin 1 and 
tetrahydrocurcumin 4 and to evaluate their biological activities. The study 
highlights the synthesis of curcumin-β-di-glucoside 3 (yield 71%) and 
tetrahydrocurcumin-β-di-glucoside 6 (yield 64%) in good yields in a biphasic 
reaction medium using a phase transfer catalyst under simple and ecofriendly 
conditions. Both the glucosyl curcuminoids showed enhanced antioxidant, 
tyrosinase enzyme inhibitory, antimicrobial and potent cytotoxic activity. The 
improved biological activity may be due to the increased solubility of the 
glucosyl conjugated compounds compared to the native curcuminoids; this was 
further confirmed by partition coefficient studies. Thus, the synthesized 
glucosyl curcumin may serve as promising future therapeutic molecule in the 
management of cancer, whereas glucosyl tetrahydrocurcumin can be a useful 
ingredient in achromatic food and in cosmetic applications.

3-(3',4',5'-Trimethoxyphenyl)-4,5,6-trimethoxy,2-(3″,4″-methylenedioxybenzylidene)-indan-1-one 
(1) is an optimized anti-cancer lead molecule obtained on modification of gallic 
acid, a plant phenolic acid. It exhibited potent cytotoxicities 
(IC50=0.010-14.76μM) against various human carcinoma cells. In cell cycle 
analysis, benzylidene indanone 1 induced G2/M phase arrest in both MCF-7 and 
MDA-MB-231 cells. It also induced apoptosis in DU145 cells which was evident by 
cleavage of PARP. In Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, benzylidene indanone 1 showed 
45.48% inhibition of tumour growth at 20mg/kg dose in Swiss albino mice. 
Further, in sub-acute toxicity experiment in Swiss-albino mice, it was found to 
be non-toxic up to 100mg/kg dose for 28days. The lead compound benzylidene 
indanone 1 can further be optimized for better anti-cancer activity.

This review, containing over 276 references, covers the progress made in the 
chemistry and bioactivity of this important group of triterpenoids. Though 
initially known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activities 
through a unique 5-LO inhibition mechanism, boswellic acids have recently 
attained significance due to their anti-cancer properties. The phytochemistry 
and chemical modifications, including mechanism of action, are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Cancer and HIV/AIDS are two of the greatest public health and 
humanitarian challenges facing the world today. Infection with HIV not only 
weakens the immune system leading to AIDS and increasing the risk of 
opportunistic infections, but also increases the risk of several types of 
cancer. The enormous biodiversity of marine habitats is mirrored by the 
molecular diversity of secondary metabolites found in marine animals, plants and 
microbes which is why this work was designed to assess the anti-HIV and 
cytotoxic activities of some marine organisms of the Red Sea.
METHODS: The lipophilic fractions of methanolic extracts of thirteen marine 
organisms collected from the Red Sea (Egypt) were screened for cytotoxicity 
against two human cancer cell lines; leukaemia (U937) and cervical cancer (HeLa) 
cells. African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) were used as normal 
non-malignant control cells. The extracts were also tested for their inhibitory 
activity against HIV-1 enzymes, reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR).
RESULTS: Cytotoxicity results showed strong activity of the Cnidarian Litophyton 
arboreum against U-937 (IC50; 6.5 μg/ml ±2.3) with a selectivity index (SI) of 
6.45, while the Cnidarian Sarcophyton trochliophorum showed strong activity 
against HeLa cells (IC50; 5.2 μg/ml ±1.2) with an SI of 2.09. Other species 
showed moderate to weak cytotoxicity against both cell lines. Two extracts 
showed potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 protease; these were the 
Cnidarian jelly fish Cassiopia andromeda (IC50; 0.84 μg/ml ±0.05) and the red 
algae Galaxura filamentosa (2.6 μg/ml ±1.29). It is interesting to note that the 
most active extracts against HIV-1 PR, C. andromeda and G. filamentosa showed no 
cytotoxicity in the three cell lines at the highest concentration tested 
(100 μg/ml).
CONCLUSION: The strong cytotoxicity of the soft corals L. arboreum and S. 
trochliophorum as well as the anti-PR activity of the jelly fish C. andromeda 
and the red algae G. filamentosa suggests the medicinal potential of crude 
extracts of these marine organisms.

Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi), an Indian medicinal plant, was used to explore 
antitumor promoting activity in a two-stage skin carcinogenesis model. For this 
purpose, mice were treated by single application of DMBA (100 microg/100 microl 
of acetone) and two weeks later promoted by croton oil (1% in acetone three 
times a week) until the end of the experiment (i.e., 16 weeks). Oral 
administration of the above extract at the preinitiational stage (i.e., seven 
days before and seven days after DMBA application; group IV), promotional stage 
(i.e., from the time of croton oil application; group V), and both pre- and 
postintiational stage (i.e., from the time of DMBA application and continued 
until the end of the experiment; group VI; on the shaven backs of the mice at 
the dose of 100 mg/kg body weight/day for 16 weeks) recorded significant 
reduction in tumor weight, tumor incidence in comparison to control (i.e., mice 
treated with DMBA and croton oil; group III). Furthermore, cumulative number of 
papillomas, tumor yield, tumor burden, and tumor weight showed significant 
reduction along with significant elevation of phase II detoxifying enzymes, and 
inhibition of lipid peroxidation in liver and skin in the animals administered 
with such plant extract concomitant to carcinogen exposure. Thus, the present 
data strongly suggests that the Tinospora cordifolia extract has anti-tumor 
potential in a two-stage skin carcinogenesis mouse model.

East Region, Assam, Dibrugarh, India.

Cancer of the oesophagus is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in males in 
Assam, in north-eastern India, and ranks second for females. The chewing of 
betel nut, with or without tobacco and prepared in various ways, is a common 
practice in the region and a case-control study has been designed to study the 
pattern of risk associated with different ways of preparing and chewing the 
nuts. 358 newly diagnosed male patients and 144 female have been interviewed 
together with 2 control subjects for each case chosen at random from among the 
attendants who accompanied patients to hospital. There were significant trends 
in risk ratios associated with the frequency of chewing each day, with the 
duration of chewing in years and with the age at which the habit was started 
that were apparent for both males and females and which remained significant 
after allowance was made for other known risk factors, notably tobacco smoking 
and alcohol consumption. The adjusted ratios, in comparison with non-chewers, 
were 13.3 M and 5.7 F for chewing more than 20 times a day, 10.6 M and 7.2 F for 
persons who had chewed for more than 20 years and 10.3 M and 5.3 F for those who 
had started before the age of 20. Among the different combinations of 
ingredients that were chewed the adjusted odds ratios were highest for those who 
had been using fermented betel nut with any form of tobacco (7.1 M and 3.6 F). 
The risk associated with tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, which are high 
in some parts of the world, were less in Assam than those associated with the 
chewing of betel nut.

Aqueous, organic and alcoholic extracts of over 100 samples of 60 species of 
Kallawaya medicinal herbs representing 30 plant families were assayed to compare 
their toxicity and ability to protect MT-2 T-lymphoblastoid cells from the 
cytopathic effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The results are 
reported as a therapeutic index (TI) which was > 25 for eighteen species, 
including seven > 50 and one > 100. The anti-HIV activity resided primarily in 
the aqueous rather than in the organic extracts and was concentrated in plants 
used in ethnomedicine to treat lung and liver diseases.

PIP: Plants are a rich source of anti-viral substances. The National Cancer 
Institute therefore annually screens about 1500 species from Africa, Southeast 
Asia, and South and Central America, but not Bolivia, for anti-HIV activity. 
Several unique compounds with anti-HIV activity have emerged from the program. 
The Kallawaya Indians of Bolivia follow a medical tradition from the Tiahuanaco 
(400-1145), Mollo (1145-1435), Inca (1438-1532), Spanish (1532-1825), and 
Bolivian Republic (from 1825) which is only recently starting to be reported. 
They use approximately 900 of the more than 2000 medicinal plants found across 
Bolivia. Aqueous, organic, and alcoholic extracts of more than 100 samples of 60 
species of Kallawaya medicinal herbs representing 30 plant families were assayed 
to compare their toxicity and ability to protect MT-2 T-lymphoblastoid cells 
from the cytopathic effects of HIV. The therapeutic index (TI) of sampled 
species is defined as the ratio of anti-HIV activity to toxic concentration. A 
TI of greater than 25 was chosen as the prerequisite for future 
bioassay-directed isolation of the active components as leads for potential new 
anti-HIV drugs. TI was greater than 25 for 18 species, including seven greater 
than 50 and one greater than 100. The anti-HIV activity resided mainly in the 
aqueous extracts and was concentrated in plants used in ethnomedicine to treat 
lung and liver diseases.

To explore in vitro anticancer potential of Aerva lanata L. (flowering aerial 
part). The study was performed with 5 different human cell lines for the study 
of lung, leukaemia, prostate, colon and cervix cancer by using Sulphorhodamine B 
(SRB) assay. There were three doses of 10, 30 and 100 microg mL(-1) of each 
Aerva lanata L. Chloroform fraction (ALCF) and Aerva lanata L. Ethyl Acetate 
Fraction (ALEAF) used in this study. ALCF showed significant % inhibitory effect 
for leukaemia, lung and colon cancer at maximum concentration of 100 microg 
mL(-1) as compared to standard drug mitomycin. On the other hand ALEAF showed 
the significant % inhibitory effect for lung and cervix cancer at maximum 
concentration of 100 microg mL(-1) as compared to standard drug 5-fluoro Uracil 
(5-FU). From the above studies it is concluded that, the ethyl acetate fraction 
and chloroform fraction of Aerva lanata L. provide enough experimental evidence 
for anticancer activity and these fractions could be useful in medical care.

The present study portrays the isolation of four phenylpropanoids - ferulic acid 
(FA), sinapic acid (SA), caffeic acid (CA), and chlorogenic acid (CHA) from the 
water extract of Suaeda maritima (L.) Dumort, a phytochemically less explored 
Indian medicinal plant. Further, synthesis and characterization of silver and 
gold nanoparticles using the isolated phenylpropanoids were done. The silver 
nanoparticles synthesized from S. maritima water extract along with silver 
nano-conjugated forms of the isolated compounds exhibited appreciable 
anti-leukemic activity against K562 cells (human myeloid leukemia). Especially, 
the ferulic and CA-conjugated silver nanoparticles showed significant (P < .01) 
activity against leukemia.

Medicine of the Maya Ameridians.

While perhaps best known for their advanced calendars and knowledge of 
astronomy, the Maya also developed an advanced pharmaceutical science that has 
been maintained by their descendants. Because of the diverse habitats found in 
the region, from mountains to deep valleys, the complex ecosystem of the 
highland Maya is the world's third richest in numbers of vascular plant species. 
The rain forests of this area are a rich source of potential new drugs. 
According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, more than 25% of the 
ingredients in today's cancer medicines were either discovered in rain forests 
or are analogues or derivatives of such compounds. Although much of the Mayan 
medical knowledge continues to be practiced by their descendants, the Mayan 
medical traditions are fading because of increased urbanization. Meanwhile, the 
source of their pharmacopeia is disappearing as the tropical rain forests are 
cleared for development. Consequently, measures to preserve this pharmaceutical 
knowledge are of great importance.

Nyctanthes arbortristis Linn (Oleaceae) is widely distributed in sub-Himalayan 
regions and southwards to Godavari, India commonly known as Harsingar and Night 
Jasmine. In continuation of our drug discovery programme on Indian medicinal 
plants, we isolated arbortristoside-A (1) and 7-O-trans-cinnamoyl 
6β-hydroxyloganin (2) from the seeds of N. Arbortristis, which exhibited 
moderate in vitro anticancer activity. Chemical transformation of 2 led to 
significant improvement in the activity in derivative 8 and 15 against HepG2 
(human hepatocellular carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines. The 
compounds 8 and 15 were also capable of cell cycle arrest and caspase dependent 
apoptosis in HepG2 cell lines. These iridoid derivatives hold promise for 
developing safer alternatives to the marketed drugs.

Study of antitumor and radiosensitizing properties of W. somnifera 
(Ashwagandha), a well known medicinal plant, have yielded encouraging results. 
The alcoholic extract of the dried roots of the plant as well as the active 
component withaferin A isolated from the extract showed significant antitumor 
and radiosensitizing effects in experimental tumors in vivo, without any 
noticeable systemic toxicity. Withaferin A gave a sensitizer enhancement ratio 
of 1.5 for in vitro cell killing of V79 Chinese hamster cells at a non toxic 
concentration of approximately 2 microM. The mechanism of action of this 
compound is not known. The studies so far indicate that W. somnifera could prove 
to be a good natural source of a potent and relatively safe 
radiosensitizer/chemotherapeutic agent. Further studies are needed to explore 
the clinical potential of this plant for cancer therapy.

Plants have been an important source for discovery of anticancer compounds. With 
the current decline in the number of new molecular entities from the 
pharmaceutical industry, novel anticancer agents are being sought from 
traditional medicines; therefore the anticancer efficacy of many plants that are 
used in traditional medicine is yet to be verified. The objective of the study 
was to evaluate the cytotoxic potential of ethanolic leaf gall extract of 
Terminalia chebula are evaluated against buffalo rat liver 3A, MCF-7 (Human 
mammary gland adenocarcinoma) and A-549 (Human lung cancer) cell lines. The 
cytotoxic effect of the ethanolic extract was evaluated by MTT assay. The 
extract was potent and effective in inducing cytotoxic effects in all the cell 
lines with an IC50 value of 305.18 ± 1.7 μg/mL, 643.13 ± 4.2 μg/mL, and 208.16 ± 
3.7 μ/mL, respectively. The extract was more effective against A549 cell lines 
when compared to others. The presences of phenolics, triterpenoids, and 
flavonoids were identified in the extract. The extract showed total phenolic and 
flavonoid content of 478 ± 2.2 mg of gallic acid equivalent/g d.w and 538 ± 1.4 
mg of quercetinequivalent/g d.w, respectively. This higher content of total 
phenolics and flavonoids found in the ethanolic extract was directly associated 
to higher cytotoxicity activity.
CONCLUSION: The ethanolic leaf gall extract of T. chebula showed effective 
cytotoxic activities; which might be attributed to the phenolics/flavonoids 
present in higher concentration. Future work will be interesting to know the 
chemical composition of the extract and also better understand the mechanism of 
action of the constituents present in the extract to develop it as drug for 
therapeutic application.
SUMMARY: The present investigation establishes the anticancer activities of T. 
chebula leaf gall extracts on BRL3A, MCF-7, and A-549 cells. Presumably, these 
activities could be attributed in part to the phenolics/flavanoids features of 
the extract that has been demonstrated to act as cytotoxic agents. The 
experimental evidence obtained in the laboratory model could provide a rationale 
for the traditional use of plant as a source of easily available effective 
anticancer agents to the people, particularly in developing countries.

Withaferin A (WA) is a steroidal lactone purified from medicinal plant "Indian 
Winter Cherry" that is widely researched for its variety of properties, 
including antitumor effects. However, the primary molecular target of WA is 
unknown. By chemical structure analysis, we hypothesized that Withaferin A might 
be a natural proteasome inhibitor. Computational modeling studies consistently 
predict that C1 and C24 of WA are highly susceptible toward a nucleophilic 
attack by the hydroxyl group of N-terminal threonine of the proteasomal 
chymotrypsin subunit beta5. Furthermore, WA potently inhibits the 
chymotrypsin-like activity of a purified rabbit 20S proteasome (IC50=4.5 microM) 
and 26S proteasome in human prostate cancer cultures (at 5-10 microM) and 
xenografts (4-8 mg/kg/day). Inhibition of prostate tumor cellular proteasome 
activity in cultures and in vivo by WA results in accumulation of ubiquitinated 
proteins and three proteasome target proteins (Bax, p27, and IkappaB-alpha) 
accompanied by androgen receptor protein suppression (in androgen-dependent 
LNCaP cells) and apoptosis induction. Treatment of WA under conditions of the 
aromatic ketone reduction, or reduced form of Celastrol, had significantly 
decreased the proteasome-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing activities. Treatment 
of human prostate PC-3 xenografts with WA for 24 days resulted in 70% inhibition 
of tumor growth in nude mice, associated with 56% inhibition of the tumor tissue 
proteasomal chymotrypsinlike activity. Our results demonstrate that the tumor 
proteasome beta5 subunit is the primary target of WA, and inhibition of the 
proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity by WA in vivo is responsible for, or 
contributes to, the antitumor effect of this ancient medicinal compound.

Several lines of evidence indicate that Fibronectin Extra Domain A (EDA) 
promotes metastatic capacity of tumor cells by engaging cell surface α9β1 
integrins. This interaction mediated by the C-C loop of EDA activates 
pro-oncogenic signaling pathways leading to epithelial to mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) of tumor cells, thus signifying its importance in control of metastatic 
progression. In this context the present study was designed to explore the 
active compounds from selected ethno-medicinal plants of western Himalayan 
region for targeting EDA of Fibronectin in lung carcinoma cells. Structure based 
informatics for drug designing and screening was employed to generate a lead 
compound(s) feed that were conformationally and energetically viable. Out of 120 
compounds selected, Irigenin showed best binding-affinity with C-C loop of EDA. 
Irigenin specifically targeted α9β1 and α4β1 integrin binding sites on EDA 
comprising LEU46, PHE47, PRO48, GLU58, LEU59 and GLN60 in its C-C loop as 
evaluated by energy decomposition per residue of Irigenin-EDA complex. In-vitro 
cell motility assays complemented with EDA knock-in and knockdown assays 
distinctively demonstrated that Irigenin prevents metastatic capacity of lung 
cancer cells by selectively blocking EDA. The results presented thus project 
Irigenin as a lead compound to overcome Fibronectin EDA induced metastatic 
progression in lung carcinoma cells.

Although a number of chemicals have been isolated from Lantana camara, only a 
few have been evaluated for their biological significance. As part of our drug 
discovery program for cytotoxic agents from Indian medicinal plants, roots of L. 
camara L. were chemically investigated, which resulted in the isolation and 
identification of a cytotoxic agent, oleanolic acid (1b) as a major constituent. 
Oleanolic acid was converted into six semi-synthetic ester (2-7) and seven amide 
(8-14) derivatives. The ester derivatives (2-7) showed 3-6 times more selective 
activity than 1b against the human ovarian cancer cell line (IGR-OV-1), while 
amide derivatives 8-14 showed 16-53 times more selective activity against the 
human lung cancer cell line (HOP-62). Structure activity relationship within the 
ester (2-7) and amide (8-14) derivatives are discussed.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Crassocephalum rubens is found throughout 
tropical Africa including the Indian Ocean islands. The leaves are commonly 
eaten in form of soups and sauces in South-Western Nigeria, also in other humid 
zones of Africa. Traditionally, it is used as an antidote against any form of 
poisoning; used to treat stomach and liver complaints; and externally to treat 
burns, sore eyes, earache, leprosy and breast cancer. In this study, acute and 
subacute toxicity of aqueous extract of C. rubens leaves was evaluated in rats 
in order to assess its safety profile.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In acute toxicity study, rats were given a single oral 
administration of aqueous extract of C. rubens leaves at graded doses 
(250-5000mg/kg). The animals were monitored for behavioural changes and possible 
mortality over a period of 24h and thereafter, for 14 days. In the subacute 
toxicity study, rats of both sexes were administered C. rubens orally at doses 
of 250mg/kg, 500mg/kg, 750mg/kg and 1000mg/kg body weight daily, for 28 days. 
Rats were observed weekly for any changes in general behaviour and body weights. 
In addition, other relevant parameters were assayed at the end of the main and 
reversibility study periods.
RESULTS: There was no observed adverse effect; including mortality in the 
animals. The extract caused no significant difference in the body weights as 
well as organs weights of treated groups when compared with the control groups. 
Haematological and biochemical parameters also revealed no toxic effects of the 
extract on rats. Histological assessments were normal in liver and kidney.
CONCLUSIONS: It can therefore be suggested based on the results from this study 
that aqueous extract of C. rubens leaves, at dosage levels up to 1000mg/kg, is 
non-toxic and could also offer protection on some body tissues. Aqueous extract 
of C. rubens could therefore, be considered safe. This study supports the 
application of Crassocephalum rubens in traditional medicine.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Aucklandia costus Falc. a medicinal plant is 
native to the Himalayan region and synonymous with Saussurea costus, Saussurea 
lappa, and Aucklandia lappa. It has an ancient background of being used 
ethnopharmacologically for various body ailments. According to Ayurveda, Unani, 
Siddha, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Costus roots are recommended for 
leukoderma, liver, kidney, blood disorders, Qi stagnation, and tridosha. Root 
and powder are used orally with warm water to cure gastric problems, and the 
paste is applied to the inflamed area to relieve pain. Root paste is applied on 
the skin to cure boils, blisters, and leprosy.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present review is to establish a correlation 
among the ethnopharmacological uses and scientific studies conducted on A. 
costus with chemical constituents, safety & toxicity data including future 
directions for its conservation with higher yield and effect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted by studying books, research 
papers, and literature in history, agroforestry, phytopharmacology of Himalayan 
plants using international databases, publication, Red data book, and reports. 
The search engines: Pubmed, Scopus, Wiley Inter-science, Indian Materia Medica, 
Science Direct, and referred journals are referenced.
RESULTS: The literature collected from databases, journals, websites, and books 
mentioned the use of costus roots in local and traditional practices. CITES 
included A. costus in a critically endangered category due to lack of cultural 
practices and overexploitation from wild. A. costus roots are known since 13th 
century for use in ancient Ayurvedic products but the scientific evaluation is 
of future research interest. A correlation of traditional uses with scientific 
studies has been explored to assess the effect of root powder, extract, oil and 
isolated constituents: Costunolids, Saussureamine B and Dehydrocostus lactone 
etc. in gastric ulceration and lesions; inhibition of antigen-induced 
degranulation, mucin production, number of immune cells, eosinophils, and 
expression and secretion of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) in asthma. The 
inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators is also reported by Cynaropicrin, 
Alantolactone, Caryophyllene, Costic acid. Also, the sesquiterpene lactones has 
profound effect in inhibition of inflammatory stages and induced apoptotic 
cascades in cancer. Very few data on the safety and toxicity of plant parts have 
been noted which needs to be evaluated scientifically.
CONCLUSION: A. costus have been noted to have remarkable effect for gastric, 
hepatic, inflammatory, respiratory, cancer, skin problems but there were several 
errors in selection of plant material, authentification, selection of dose, 
assessment, selection of standard and control have been identified. Therefore, a 
schematic drug development and research strategy exploiting the potential of 
plant extract, fraction, products and probable constituents, costunolide, 
dehydrocostus lactone, cynaropicrin, saussureamine assuring dose-response 
relationship and safety may be determined under pre-clinical which may be 
extrapolated to clinical level. An evaluation of phytochemicals in A. costus 
collected from different geographical location in Himalayas may be drawn to 
identify and conserve the higher yielding plant.

Carissa congesta Wight and Benincasa hispida (Thunb.) Cogn. as budding 
immunomodulatory agents.

Une HD, Doshi GM.

Carissa congesta and Benincasa hispida are well-known medicinally important 
plants associated with diabetes, inflammation, protozal infections and cancer. 
Here, we emphasized up on the immunomodulatory potential of these plants as the 
source of lupeol, P-sitosterol and ursolic acid. Petroleum ether extracts of C. 
congesta roots and B. hispida seeds were subjected to acute toxicity studies. 
They were screened for its immunomodulatory prospective in rats by 
Haemagglutination Antibody (HA) titre and Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) 
response using Sheep Red Blood Cells (SRBCs of-0.5x10⁹) as antigens. Carbon 
Clearance test (Phagocytic Index) was estimated by Indian ink suspension. 
Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) induced arthritis model interpretation was done 
by paw edema, kene joint erosion (transverse section), body weights, arthritic 
index and biochemical levels (RBC, WBC and Hb levels). Both the extracts were 
found to be therapeutically safe up to 5000 mg/kg. Dosage of 100 mg/kg was not 
satisfactory; and 500 and 250 mg/kg showed significant immunostimmulation (HA 
Titre) and immunosuppression (DTH response, 48 h). Benincasa hispida seed and 
Carissa congesta root extracts showed phagocytic Index of 0.0163±0.003, 
0.0145±0.003 and 0.0183±0.003, 0.0176±0.003 at 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg, 
respectively. CFA model revealed that the B. hispida seed and C. congesta root 
extracts decreased paw volume, knee joint erosion, increased body weights and 
biochemical parameters with an arthritic index of 1.31±0.12, 1.44±0.15 and 1. 
16±0.09, 1.36±0.13 at 250 mg/kg and 500 mg, respectively. The results were 
interpreted by One- way ANOVA followed by Dunnett test. Extracts showed 
relevance as promising immunostimulators as compared to control.

A series of eleven novel bisindole derivatives were synthesized and screened for 
anticancer and antiobesity potentials in in vitro mode. The reaction of 1-ethoxy 
carbonyl 4-pyperidone 1a with indole-3-carboxaldehyde 1b in presence of 
catalytic amount of piperidine gave 2 which was N-alkylated with different 
benzyl halides in the presence of potassium carbonate to afford compounds 3a-3k 
in quantitative yields. Among the compounds tested for anticancer activity 
against different human cancer cell lines, 3f significantly inhibited HepG2 cell 
line (IC50 7.33 μM) when compared with standard doxorubicin (IC50 10.15 μM). 
Compounds 3e (IC50 2.75 μM), 3f (IC50 4.21 μM) and 3i (IC50 15.98 μM) showed 
better activity than the standard curcumin (IC50 23.54 μM) against A549 cell 
line. Also, among the synthesized compounds, 3g (IC50 14.89 μM), 3c (IC50 56.41 
μM) and 3i (IC50 30.88 μM) have potentially inhibited enzyme lipase when 
compared to standard Orlistat (IC50 62.25 μM). In in silico docking assays, 
piperidones 3e, 3f, 3i, 3c and 3a showed higher binding affinity towards 
anti-cancer target of A549 (3e: -11.1, 3f: -10.3, 3c: -11.3, 3i: -11.2 
kcal/mol), HepG2 (3f: -10.5 kcal/mol), HeLa (3d: -10.0 kcal/mol) and SKOV3 (3f: 
-8.4 kcal/mol) cell lines better than standard drug doxorubicin. Docking to 
lipase protein for compounds 3i, 3g and 3c showed scores of -11.1, -10.7 and 
-10.5 kcal/mol when compared to that of standard drug Orlistat with -6.9 
kcal/mol.

The rising incidence of skin cancer in humans makes it equivalent to 
malignancies of organs. Therefore, it is necessary to intensify our efforts for 
better understanding and development of novel treatment and preventive 
approaches for skin cancer. Fruits and other plant derived products have gained 
considerable attention as they can reduce the risk of several cancer types. 
Lupeol, a triterpene, present in many fruits and medicinal plants, has been 
shown to possess many pharmacological properties including anti-cancer effect in 
both in vitro and in vivo assay systems. In the present study, apoptosis 
inducing effects of lupeol were studied in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 
cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that lupeol treatment induces apoptosis 
(14-37%) in a dose-dependent manner as evident by an increased sub G(1) cell 
population. The RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that lupeol-induced 
apoptosis was associated with caspase dependent mitochondrial cell death pathway 
through activation of Bax, caspases, Apaf1, decrease in Bcl-2 expression and 
subsequent cleavage of PARP. Lupeol treatment also inhibited Akt/PKB signaling 
pathway by inhibition of Bad (Ser136) phosphorylation and 14-3-3 expression. In 
addition, lupeol treatment inhibited cell survival by inactivation of NFkappaB 
through upregulation of its inhibitor Ikappabetaalpha. The Caspase mediated 
apoptosis was noticed by decrease in lupeol induced apoptosis by Caspase 
inhibitors as well as increase in reactive oxygen species generation and loss of 
mitochondrial membrane potential. These results suggest that lupeol could be an 
effective anti-cancer agent and merits further investigation.

Methanolic extract (75%) of Terminalia chebula, Terminalia belerica, Emblica 
officinalis and their combination named 'Triphala' (equal proportion of above 
three plant extracts) are being used extensively in Indian system of medicine. 
They were found to inhibit lipid peroxide formation and to scavenge hydroxyl and 
superoxide radicals in vitro. The concentration of plant extracts that inhibited 
50% of lipid peroxidation induced with Fe(2+)/ascorbate were food to be 85.5, 
27, 74 and 69 micro g/ml, respectively. The concentration needed for the 
inhibition of hydoxyl radical scavenging were 165, 71, 155.5 and 151 micro g/ml, 
and that for superoxide scavenging activity were found to be 20.5, 40.5, 6.5 and 
12.5 micro g/ml, respectively. Oral administration of the extracts (100 mg/kg 
body weight) reduced the blood sugar level in normal and in alloxan (120 mg/kg) 
diabetic rats significantly within 4 h. Continued, daily administration of the 
drug produced a sustained effect.

CONTEXT: Plants harbor endophytes with potential bioactivity. Markhamia 
tomentosa (Benth) K. Schum ex. Engl. (Bignoniaceae) is reported to possess 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities.
OBJECTIVE: The antifungal and antiproliferative properties of endophytic fungi 
extracts and fractions from M. tomentosa were evaluated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves of M. 
tomentosa and identified by ITS-rDNA sequence analysis. The antagonistic effect 
of the fungal strains was investigated against pathogenic fungi viz, Fusarium 
oxysporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorium, Rhizoctonia solani, and Botrytis cinerea 
using the dual culture assay for 5-7 days. Antiproliferative effect of the 
fungal extracts and fractions (3.91-250 μg/mL) on HeLa cancer cell line was 
tested and IC50 was calculated. Poisoning food assay and antifeedant activity 
against the pathogenic fungi and Spodoptera litura larvae, for 7 days and 2 h, 
respectively, was also tested at concentrations of 250, 500 and 1000 μg/mL.
RESULTS: Fungal endophytes Trichoderma longibrachiatum and Syncephalastrum 
racemosum were isolated from the leaves of M. tomentosa. Isolated endophytic 
fungal strains and solvent extracts showed MIC value of 1000 μg/mL against 
tested pathogenic fungi in the dual culture and poisoning food assays. Methanol 
fraction of S. racemosum isolate showed the most effective antiproliferative 
activity with IC50 of 43.56 μg/mL. Minimal feeding deterrent activity against S. 
litura larvae was also observed.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These findings showed that the leaves of Markhamia 
tomentosa harbor strains of endophytic fungi with promising health benefits, and 
suggest their antifungal and antiproliferative effects against pathogenic fungi 
and HeLa cancer cell line.

BACKGROUND: Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (Solanaceae), commonly known as 
Ashwagandha, is one of the most important medicinal plant in the traditional 
Indian medical systems. Pharmacological studies have established that root 
extracts of W. somnifera contain several bioactive constituents called 
withanolides. The plant has long been used for its several beneficial properties 
and recently as an immunomodulator.
HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: A combination therapy including a potential and safe 
immunostimulant with lower doses of effective drug, which can reduce the 
parasitic burden and simultaneously can produce an enhancement of adaptive 
immunity, has proven to be significantly a more effective approach than 
immunotherapy or drug therapy alone.
STUDY DESIGN: Evaluation of the immunostimulatory effect of W. somnifera 
chemotype NMITLI 101R when used in combination with ED50 doses of 
antileishmanial drugs in Leishmania donovani infected hamsters.
METHODS: Infected animals were administered with chemotype 
101R(30mg/kg × 15 days) either alone or in combination with ED50 doses of 
miltefosine (10mg/kg × 5 days), paromomycin (30mg/kg × 5 days) or amphotericin B 
(0.5mg/kg × 5 days). The treated animals were euthanized on days 30 and 60 
post-treatment (p.t.) and checked for parasite clearance, delayed type 
hypersensitivity (DTH) response, cytokine and inducible nitric oxide synthase 
levels by real-time PCR, nitric oxide (NO) production, reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) generation, lymphoproliferative and antibody responses.
RESULTS: The group of animals that received 101R and ED50 dose of miltefosine 
showed optimum inhibition of parasite multiplication (∼98%) by day 60 p.t. 
followed by the group that received 101R plus paromomycin (∼94%) and 101R plus 
amphotericin B (∼93%). The efficacy was well supported by the increased 
inducible NO synthase mRNA transcript, strong IFN-γand IL-12 mediated Th1 immune 
responses and significantly suppressed levels of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10 and 
TGF-β). Additionally, same therapy also induced significant increase in the 
level of NO production, ROS generation, Leishmania specific IgG2 antibody along 
with profound DTH and strong T-cell responses as compared with all the other 
treated groups.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that combination of chemotype 101R with ED50 
doses of antileishmanial drugs may provide a promising alternative for the cure 
of visceral leishmaniasis with significant restoration of the host immune 
response.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The decoction of the roots of Hemidesmus indicus 
is widely used in the Indian traditional medicine for the treatment of blood 
diseases, dyspepsia, loss of taste, dyspnea, cough, poison, menorrhagia, fever, 
and diarrhea. Poly-herbal preparations containing Hemidesmus are often used by 
traditional medical practitioners for the treatment of cancer. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the cytodifferentiative, cytostatic and cytotoxic 
potential of a decoction of Hemidesmus indicus's roots (0.31-3 mg/mL) on a human 
promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The decoction of Hemidesmus indicus was characterized by 
HPLC to quantify its main phytomarkers. Induction of apoptosis, cell-cycle 
analysis, levels of specific membrane differentiation markers were evaluated by 
flow cytometry. The analysis of cell differentiation by nitroblue tetrazolium 
(NBT) reducing activity, adherence to the plastic substrate, α-napthyl acetate 
esterase activity and morphological analysis was performed through light 
microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
RESULTS: Starting from the concentration of 0.31 mg/ml, Hemidesmus indicus 
induced cytotoxicity and altered cell-cycle progression, through a block in the 
G0/G1 phase. The decoction caused differentiation of HL-60 cells as shown by NBT 
reducing activity, adherence to the plastic substrate, α-naphtyl acetate 
esterase activity, and increasing expression of CD14 and CD15. The morphological 
analysis by LM and TEM clearly showed the presence of granulocytes and 
macrophages after Hemidesmus indicus treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The cytodifferentiating, cytotoxic and cytostatic activities of 
Hemidesmus indicus offers a scientific basis for its use in traditional 
medicine. Its potent antileukemic activity provides a pre-clinical evidence for 
its traditional use in anticancer pharmacology. Further experiments are 
worthwhile to determine the in vivo anticancer potential of this plant decoction 
and its components.

Herbs have been used for medicinal purposes, including the treatment of 
diabetes, for centuries. Plants containing flavonoids are used to treat diabetes 
in Indian medicine and the green tea flavonoid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), 
is reported to have glucose-lowering effects in animals. We show here that the 
regulation of hepatic glucose production is decreased by EGCG. Furthermore, like 
insulin, EGCG increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and 
insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and it reduces phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxykinase gene expression in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner. 
EGCG also mimics insulin by increasing phosphoinositide 3-kinase, 
mitogen-activated protein kinase, and p70(s6k) activity. EGCG differs from 
insulin, however, in that it affects several insulin-activated kinases with 
slower kinetics. Furthermore, EGCG regulates genes that encode gluconeogenic 
enzymes and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation by modulating the redox state of 
the cell. These results demonstrate that changes in the redox state may have 
beneficial effects for the treatment of diabetes and suggest a potential role 
for EGCG, or derivatives, as an antidiabetic agent.

Oral lesions, genotoxicity and nitrosamines in betel quid chewers with no 
obvious increase in oral cancer risk.

Stich HF, Rosin MP, Brunnemann KD.

A link between the generation of areca nut-related N-nitrosamines in the saliva, 
the induction of genotoxic damage in the oral mucosa, as judged by an increase 
in micronucleated exfoliated cells (MEC), and a low incidence of oral cancer was 
studied in 2 population groups characterized by their habit of chewing quids 
without tobacco: Guamanians, who chew areca nuts (Areca catechu) with or without 
the addition of betel leaf (Piper betle); Taiwanese, who use areca nut, betel 
leaf or inference and slaked lime. The levels of N-nitrosoguvacoline (NG) in the 
saliva of chewers of fresh green areca nuts were very high (70.8 ng/ml) as 
compared to those reported for individuals using the more complex Indian betel 
quids (0.91 ng/ml or 5.6 ng/ml). None of the other areca nut-related 
nitrosamines (N-nitrosoguvacine (NGC), 3-(methylnitrosamino)propionitrile (MNPN) 
and 3-(methylnitrosamino)propionaldehyde (MNPA)) were detected in the saliva of 
Taiwanese betel quid chewers. The addition of slaked lime to the areca nut 
enhances the formation of NG during a chewing session. The frequency of MEC did 
not increase in the oral mucosa of areca nut chewers who do not use slaked lime, 
but showed a small but significant elevation in individuals using 
lime-containing quids. The elevation of MEC in Taiwanese, who are at low risk 
for oral cancer, is relatively small as compared to that found in chewers of 
Indian betel quids (pan), who show a highly elevated oral cancer risk. The 
results seem to suggest that NG may play only a minor role, if any, in the 
etiology of oral cancer among betel quid chewers.

Angiogenesis is critical in both physiological and pathological conditions and 
targeting angiogenesis is a promising strategy for the development of therapies 
against cancer; however, cells develop resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy, 
necessitating a more effective strategy. Natural medicines have been used in 
anti-cancer therapy for many years, but the mechanisms behind these have not 
generally been explored. Triphala churna (THL), an Indian ayurvedic herbal 
formulation made from the dried fruits of three medicinal plants, is used as a 
herbal drug for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. THL 
contains over fifteen phytochemicals with different pharmacological effects, 
especially inhibition of tumor progression. In this study, we examined the 
effect of these compounds against different targets using docking and in vitro 
studies. Results showed that THL has a prediction efficacy of (-436.7), and it 
inhibited angiogenesis by blocking multiple components of the VEGF/VEGFR2 
signaling pathway. The anti-angiogenic effect was mediated by the combined 
effect of the two top ranked phytochemicals, punicalagin (-424.8) and chebulagic 
acid (-414.8). The new approach developed in this study to determine the 
potential efficacy of herbal formulation could be a useful strategy to assess 
the efficacy of different herbal formulations.

Mutations and polymorphisms in the p53, p21 and p16 genes in oral carcinomas of 
Indian betel quid chewers.

Biology, National University of Singapore.

India has one of the world's highest incidences of oral cancer. It is believed 
that the widespread habit of betel quid chewing is an important risk factor as 
it exposes the oral mucosa to known carcinogens. It also induces physical 
abrasions, which may create mitogenic environments during wound healing as 
gateways for infections. A recent study from our laboratories identified human 
papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, mostly of the high-risk types HPV-16 and HPV-18, in 67 
of 91 oral cancer lesions from a cohort of Indian patients consisting mostly of 
betel quid users. This suggested a viral etiology of some lesions but 
tumorigenesis in the absence of viruses in other lesions. Here, we examined 
whether the p53 gene, whose function is abrogated by the product of the HPV gene 
E6, would be mutated in those oral cancers that were free of HPV DNA, and we 
found point mutations at known hot spots for mutational alteration of p53 in 4 
of 23 lesions. We also considered the possibility that p21, a target of 
regulation by the p53 protein, may be mutationally altered in tumors with a 
functional p53 gene. While we did not identify mutations in the p21 gene, 6 of 
11 lesions contained a polymorphism that may be associated with cancer. 
Interestingly, 3 of 23 lesions had mutations in the p16 gene, a third regulator 
of the cell cycle which is frequently mutated in melanoma but rarely in other 
cancers, with 1 lesion even having a mutation in the p53 as well as in the p16 
gene. Our data point to p53 and p16 as gene targets of oral carcinogenesis, with 
chemicals in the betel quid possibly functioning in these tumors as carcinogens.

Prevention of cancer through nutritional intervention has gained significant 
recognition in recent years. Evidence revealed from mechanistic investigations 
coupled with molecular epidemiology show an inverse association of dietary 
flavonoids intake with cancer risk. The chemopreventive and anticarcinogenic 
potential of Selaginella bryopteris, a traditional Indian herb referred to as 
'Sanjeevani' in the Ayurvedic system of medicine, was examined in the present 
study. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted on the 
flavonoid-rich benzene fraction of the aqueous extract that demonstrated a 
significant cytoprotective activity. Biomarkers of chemoprevention such as 
proliferative index and status of cell-cycle regulatory proteins, antioxidant 
property, anti-inflammatory effect, reversal of stress-induced senescence and 
genoprotective effect were investigated in human and murine cell cultures. 
Chemopreventive potential was assessed in benzopyrene-induced lung 
carcinogenesis and 7,12-dimethyl benz(a)anthracene-mediated skin 
papillomagenesis test models. Inhibition of DNA fragmentation, unperturbed 
cell-cycle regulation, maintenance of intracellular antioxidant defence, 
anti-inflammatory activity, prevention of stress-induced senescence and 
genoprotective effects against methyl isocyanate carcinogenicity was observed. 
Medium-term anticarcinogenicity and two-stage skin papillomagenesis tests 
strongly substantiated our in vitro observations. Results from the present study 
provide evidence of anticarcinogenic and chemopreventive activities of S. 
bryopteris hitherto unreported and reaffirm the nutritional significance of 
flavonoids in cancer prevention.

Chemoprevention is a novel approach to study the anti-initiating and 
anti-tumor-promoting efficacy of medicinal plants and their active principles. 
The present study investigated the chemopreventive potential of Aegle marmelos 
fruit extract in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced skin carcinogenesis and 
its influence on oxidative stress and the antioxidant defense system. The oral 
administration of A marmelos at 100 mg/kg body weight/day during 
peri-initiational, postinitiational, and peri- & postinitiational phases of 
papillomagenesis showed significant reduction in tumor incidence, tumor yield, 
tumor burden, and cumulative number of papillomas when compared with 
carcinogen-treated control. The average latent period significantly increased 
(7.88 weeks; control group) to 9.45, 11.11, and 11.54 weeks in different A 
marmelos extract (AME) experimental groups. Enzyme analysis of skin and liver 
showed a significant elevation in antioxidant parameters such as superoxide 
dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and vitamin C in AME-treated groups when 
compared with the carcinogen-treated control. The elevated level of lipid 
peroxidation in the positive control was significantly inhibited by AME 
administration. These results indicate that AME has the potential to reduce 
chemical-induced skin papillomas by enhancing the antioxidant defense system.

The phenanthroindolizidine plant alkaloids pergularinine (PGL) and 
tylophorinidine (TPD) isolated from the Indian medicinal herb Pergularia pallida 
have been evaluated for their biological activity and assessed for the first 
time employing dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (5,6,7,8-THF: NADP(+) 
oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) as the probe in the present investigations. The 
enzyme is a key target in cancer chemotherapy and has been purified from 
Lactobacillus leichmannii. Cytotoxicity studies showed that both PGL and TPD are 
potently toxic and inhibited the growth of L. leichmannii cells (IC(50)=45 and 
40 microM, respectively). Both the alkaloids significantly inhibited DHFR 
activity (IC(50)=40 and 32 microM for PGL and TPD, respectively). Alkaloid 
concentrations greater than 75-95 microM resulted in a complete loss of DHFR 
activity. Our results are suggestive of the alkaloids as potential antimicrobial 
and antitumour compounds. Alkaloid binding to DHFR is slow and reversible. 
Inhibition kinetics revealed K(i) values of 9x10(-6) M and 7x10(-6) M for PGL 
and TPD, respectively for the enzyme and inhibition in both the cases was a 
simple linear 'non-competitive' type.

OBJECTIVES: To determine use of alcohol, tobacco and paan among males from the 
various Asian communities in Leicester; and assess their knowledge and attitudes 
towards oral cancer risk factors and prevention. Also, to determine any 
differences regarding habits and attitudes between first and second generation 
Asians.
DESIGN: Volunteers completed a confidential, bilingual questionnaire regarding 
alcohol, tobacco and paan use and also knowledge about oral cancer risk factors 
and preventive measures.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from sources that included GPs' surgeries, 
sixth form colleges and places of worship.
SUBJECTS: Asian males, i.e. those of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Sri 
Lankan origin; over the age of 16 years and resident in Leicester.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative figures were obtained from the 
questionnaires as to the frequency of alcohol, tobacco and paan use and 
responses regarding oral cancer knowledge, risk factors and preventive measures.
RESULTS: The principal Asian community groups in Leicester were Hindu, Sikh, 
Muslim and Jain. Significant differences were found in males from these groups 
with regards to habits and oral cancer awareness. Muslim males use tobacco and 
paan more than the other groups but avoid alcohol. Sikh males drink more alcohol 
(especially spirits) than the other groups but their use of tobacco and paan is 
low. Habits of Hindu and Jain males are variable. However, approximately 10% of 
both 1st and 2nd generation Hindu males combine all three habits of alcohol, 
tobacco and paan; and are thus considered to be at high risk of developing oral 
cancer. Seven percent of 1st generation Hindu males were found to chew paans 
containing tobacco which are strongly associated with oral cancer. More 2nd 
generation Jains drank alcohol than the 1st generation, and a greater proportion 
of Hindu, Sikh and Jain 2nd generation males drink spirits than their older 
counterparts. Knowledge of oral cancer risk factors and preventive measures were 
variable, the lowest level of knowledge being among the 1st generation Sikh 
group. Few volunteers realised the risk of alcohol drinking in the aetiology of 
oral cancer.
CONCLUSION: The 'Asian' community in Leicester is not homogeneous, but consists 
of distinct community groups; each with their own cultural beliefs, habits and 
attitudes. Knowledge of these differences can be used to provide appropriate 
health education programmes suitably targeted to reduce the use of the known 
risk factors for oral cancer.

Chronic arsenic exposure causes skin diseases, gastrointestinal and neurological 
disorders, diabetes and cancer in various organs. Oxidative stress associated 
with arsenic exposure cause genetic instabilities and may initiate 
carcinogenesis. Phytochemicals present in vegetables, fruits, spices, tea, and 
medicinal plants, have shown to suppress experimental carcinogenesis in various 
organs. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the protective effect of 
some of the phytochemicals against the arsenite induced DNA damage in normal 
mammalian V79 cells. Comet assay was used for assessment of DNA damage and 2', 
7'-dichlorofluorescein dihydroacetate for estimation of ROS generated by 
arsenite. The effect of the phytochemicals was observed during simultaneous 
treatment with arsenic, before arsenite exposure and during repair experiments. 
Of all the phytochemicals tested against arsenic, curcumin gave better 
protection during simultaneous treatment and resveratrol during pre treatment, 
which was evident both from comet assay and ROS generation experiments. During 
pre treatment a longer duration of treatment with lower dose of phytochemicals 
proved fruitful in reducing the genotoxicity. During repair experiments the 
phytochemicals enhanced recovery of DNA damage and ellagic acid gave promising 
results. The results indicated that natural phytochemicals may have the efficacy 
in reducing arsenic induced genotoxicity, in scavenging ROS and in enhancing the 
process of DNA repair in V79 cells.

Center, Heidelberg.

Oral cancer is the most common cancer in males and third most common in females 
in India, the main causative agent being the use of chewing tobacco with or 
without betel quid (BQ). However, nothing is known about the role of the host 
metabolic genes in oral cancer in ethnic Indian population. In this study, the 
prevalence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes (GSTM1*2 and GSTT1*2) in oral 
premalignant leukoplakia cases and controls was ascertained in genomic DNA by a 
multiplex PCR technique. Biopsies taken from 98 oral leukoplakia patients and 
exfoliated cells from 82 healthy controls both of Indian ethnicity were 
analysed. GSTM1*1 (active) was present in 83% and GSTT1*1 (active) was present 
in 78% of all control subjects, while prevalence of GSTM1*2 and GSTT1*2 null 
genotypes was significantly higher among oral leukoplakia cases. The prevalence 
of GSTM1*2 in leukoplakia cases was 81.6% compared with 17% in controls [odds 
ratio (OR), 22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1047] and GSTT1*2 was 75.5% in the 
cases versus 22% in controls (OR, 11; 95% CI, 5-22). Combined null genotypes of 
GSTM1 and GSTT1 prevailed in 60.2% of the cases with none detected in controls. 
Glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 enzymes are both known to catalyse 
detoxification of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation products and 
tobacco-derived carcinogens that have been found in the saliva of BQ/tobacco 
chewers. Our results, still requiring confirmation by a larger study, 
demonstrate that the null genotypes of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 increase with high 
penetrance, separately or in combination, the risk for developing leukoplakia in 
an Indian ethnic population.

BACKGROUND: Free radical-induced oxidative stress is the root cause for many 
human diseases. Naturally occurring antioxidant supplements from plants are 
vital to counter the oxidative damage in cells. The main objective of the 
present study was to characterize the antioxidant and antiproliferative 
potential of rice bran extracted from an important Indian rice variety, Njavara 
and to compare the same with two commercially available basmati rice varieties: 
Vasumathi, Yamini and a non medicinal variety, Jyothi.
METHODS: Methanolic extracts of rice bran from four varieties; Vasumathi, 
Yamini, Jyothi and Njavara were used to study their total phenolic and flavonoid 
contents, in vitro antioxidant activities including total antioxidant activity, 
scavenging of nitric oxide and 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, 
reducing power and cytotoxic activity in C6 glioma cells. Correlation 
coefficient and regression analysis were done by using Sigmastat version 3.1 and 
Stata statistical package respectively.
RESULTS: Rice bran methanolic extract from Njavara showed the highest 
antioxidant and cell cytotoxic properties compared to the other three rice 
varieties. IC50 values for scavenging DPPH and nitric oxide were in the range of 
30.85-87.72 microg/ml and 52.25-107.18 microg/ml respectively. Total antioxidant 
activity and reducing power were increased with increasing amounts of the 
extract. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were in the range of 3.2-12.4 mg 
gallic acid-equivalent (GAE)/g bran and 1.68-8.5 mg quercetin-equivalent (QEE)/g 
bran respectively. IC50 values of cytotoxic assay (MTT assay) were 17.53-57.78 
microg/ml. Correlation coefficient and regression analysis of phenolic content 
with DPPH and NO scavenging, MTT (-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl 
tetrazolium bromide) assay, total antioxidant assay and reducing power showed a 
highly significant correlation coefficient values (96-99%) and regression values 
(91-98%).
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that the crude methanolic 
extract from Njavara rice bran contains significantly high polyphenolic 
compounds with superior antioxidant activity as evidenced by scavenging of free 
radicals including DPPH and NO. Njavara extracts also showed highest reducing 
power activity, anti-proliferative property in C6 glioma cells. In conclusion, 
it is conceivable that the Njavara rice variety could be exploited as one of the 
potential sources for plant--based pharmaceutical products.

A new series of 1,9-acetals of forskolin were synthesized by treating with 
aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes using Ceric ammonium nitrate as catalyst and 
evaluated for anticancer and α-glucosidase inhibition activities. Among the 
synthesized compounds 2a, 2b and 3a showed potential cytotoxic activity towards 
human cancer cell lines MCF-7 (Human Breast Adenocarcinoma), MDA-MB (Human 
Breast Carcinoma), HeLa (Human Cervix Adenocarcinoma), A498 (Human Kidney 
Carcinoma), K562 (Human Erythromyeloblastoid leukemia), SH-SY5Y (Human 
Neuroblastoma), Hek293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) and WRL68 (Human Hepatic) with 
IC50 values ranging between 0.95 and 47.96 μg/ml. Osmotic fragility test 
revealed compound 3a as non-toxic to human erythrocytes at the tested 
concentrations of 50 and 100 μg/ml. Compounds 1g (IC50 value 0.76 μg/ml) and 1p 
(IC50 value 0.74 μg/ml) significantly inhibited α-glucosidase in in vitro 
system. In silico based docking, ADME and toxicity risk assessment studies also 
showed discernible α-glucosidase activity for compounds 1g, 1p compared to 
standard acarbose.

CONTEXT: A number of Blumea (Asteraceae) species are being used in traditional 
Chinese and Indian folklore medicines to cure various diseases including cancer, 
fungal and bacterial infections.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro antiplasmodial potential and cytotoxicity of 
various extracts and fractions of B. membranacea DC and B. eriantha DC and high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chemical fingerprinting of their crude 
extracts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aerial parts and roots of B. membranacea and B. 
eriantha were extracted with ethanol and the extracts were successively 
partitioned with n-hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol, which were later 
evaluated for their in vitro antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium 
falciparum NF-54 and in vitro cytotoxicities against non-cancerous Vero cell 
line. HPLC chemical fingerprinting was performed on extracts of B. membranacea 
and B. eriantha.
RESULTS: The n-hexane (MA1), ethyl acetate (MA2) fractions of aerial parts and 
n-butanol (MR3) fraction of roots of B. membranacea showed IC50 values of 17.4, 
19.0 and 3.3 µg/mL respectively, while the n-hexane (EA1), ethyl acetate (EA2) 
fractions of aerial parts and ethyl acetate (ER2) fraction of roots of B. 
eriantha showed IC50 values of 25.0, 26.5 and 15.6 µg/mL, respectively, against 
P. falciparum NF-54. All these fractions were non-toxic to Vero cells.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Both B. membranacea and B. eriantha possesses a high 
degree of selective antiplasmodial activity (selectivity index up to >60) and 
hence, may find their use in antimalarial phytopharmaceuticals as well as in 
discovery of a safer and novel antimalarial lead.

Overexpression of p53 protein in betel- and tobacco-related human oral dysplasia 
and squamous-cell carcinoma in India.

The aetiological factors for oral cancer are not the same in India and in 
Western countries. Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between high 
incidence of oral cancer and heavy consumption of betel and/or tobacco in the 
Indian population, while this study indicates an association with a genetic 
change. The p53 tumour-suppressor gene is the most commonly identified mutated 
gene in human malignancies. Expression of p53 protein was examined in 
premalignant and malignant oral lesions from Indian patients who were consumers 
of betel, areca nut and/or tobacco, using anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies PAb 
1801 and PAb 421. Cryosections from normal, premalignant or malignant oral 
mucosa were used for immunostaining and the observations were confirmed by 
immunoprecipitation. p53 protein was detected in 55% (15/27) premalignant oral 
lesions (leukoplakia). Strong p53-positive staining was detected in 75% (24/32) 
of oral squamous-cell carcinomas. Normal oral mucosa did not show positive p53 
staining (0/24). The detection of p53 protein in premalignant oral lesions 
suggests that p53 aberrations are an early event in the development of oral 
cancer in India. The high incidence of p53 positivity in leukoplakia may be due 
to differences in aetiological factors. p53 overexpression in premalignant oral 
lesions is important in view of the significantly earlier onset of leukoplakia 
in the Indian population compared to the development of oral malignancy, and may 
be helpful in identifying lesions that are more likely to progress to 
malignancy. The frequency of p53 protein overexpression was high in premalignant 
and malignant oral lesions of patients who were heavy consumers of betel, areca 
nut and tobacco.

Panel on epidemiology and etiology of laryngeal carcinoma.

Hiranandni LH.

Ours is a developing country. We have still not controlled the common infectious 
diseases which are extinct in the West; therefore, our limited resources are 
spent on study of epidemiology of infectious diseases. My conclusions on 
epidemiology of cancer of the larynx are drawn from observations made of the 
clinical material over a period of 25 years. I have come to the conclusion that 
the smoked tobacco and the slaked lime in the Indian "Pan" are the two important 
carcinogenic agents. Poor nutrition appears to be carcinogenic. It requires 
study and confirmation at a cellular level. Misuse of voice does seem to be the 
cause of laryngeal cancer. Racial, genetic and other environmental factors, 
including pollution have not contributed to the increased incidence of laryngeal 
cancers. The common histological types of laryngeal cancer are known. My 
observations on certain biological behavior of the tumor have been helpful. 1. 
An exophytic growth is less infiltrative; its metastatic mass reflects the same 
characteristics. 2. Certain anaplastic tumors can flout all laws of cancer 
spread and metastasize in distal organs. 3. Presence of reticular hyperplasia in 
peripheral lymph nodes is of good prognostic value.

We have established methodology for the isolation and characterization of a 
novel endophytic fungus from the inner bark of medicinal plant Nothapodytes 
foetida, which produced camptothecin in Sabouraud broth (SB) under shake flask 
conditions. Camptothecin and its related compounds are at present obtained by 
extraction from intact plants, but fungal endopytes may be an alternative source 
of production. In present study we have observed the effect of different 
nutrient combinations and precursors (tryptophan, tryptamine, geraniol, citral, 
mevalonic acid and leucine) on the accumulation of camptothecin by endophytic 
fungus Entrophospora infrequens. The precursors were fed either alone or in 
combinations (tryptophan and geraniol, tryptophan and citral, tryptophan and 
mevalonic acid, tryptophan and leucine). The highest camptothecin content was 
observed in the range of 503 ± 25µg/100g dry cell mass in Sabouraud medium. 
Camptothecin content in the medium was increased by 2.5 folds by the presence of 
tryptophan and leucine whereas the production with trytophan was also 
significantly different from other treatments. Furthermore, the effect of fungal 
camptothecin on the morphology of human cancer cell lines was also studied. The 
treated cells showed reduction in size, condensation of nucleus and the 
protoplasmic extensions were reduced. All these characteristics are found in 
apoptotic cells.

An oral lichen planus-like lesion in Indian betel-tobacco chewers.

Daftary DK, Bhonsle RB, Murti RB, Pindborg JJ, Mehta FS.

During an epidemiologic study of oral cancer and precancerous lesions among 
Indian villagers, a lichen planus-like lesion was observed in Kerala. The lesion 
consisted of white, wavy, parallel, non-elevated lines that could not be scraped 
off. The lesion occurred exclusively among chewers and at the site of placement 
of quid. There were no subjective symptoms. The peak prevalence of the 35 
diagnosed lesions was in the 35-44 years age-group for males and 45-54 for 
females. There was a marked female predominance. The histologic features were 
very similar to those seen in oral lichen planus.

The study investigates the antioxidant, hepatoprotective and antiproliferative 
effects of novel icetexane diterpenoids (ice 1-4) isolated from hexane extract 
of stem bark of Premna tomentosa. A549, HT-29, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, A431 cells 
were used to assess the antiproliferative activity by MTT assay. Cell death 
induced by apoptosis was determined by morphological assessment studies using 
acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining (dual staining), mitochondrial 
potential measurement by JC-1 staining, and cell cycle analysis by propidium 
iodide staining method by Muse cell analyser. Anti oxidant activity was 
investigated by in vitro assays such as DPPH, nitric oxide and superoxide 
scavenging activities. Hepatoprotective activity was determined in vitro with 
HepG2 cells and in vivo by tBHP induced hepatic damage mice model. Based on the 
in vitro cytotoxic assays and morphological assessment studies using 
fluorescence microscopic study (acridine orange and ethidium bromide double 
staining) and mitochondrial potential measurements, it was found that ice 2 and 
3 possess good antiproliferative effect via mitochondrial mediated apoptosis in 
human lung and breast cancer cells. Results of in vitro antioxidant studies 
demonstrated that ice-4 has showed good antioxidant activity. The restoration of 
serum levels of SGOT, SGPT and ALKP, liver GSH status and reduction or 
inhibition of lipid peroxidation in liver of tBHP intoxicated mice after 
administration of ice-4 at dose of 250mg/kg indicated its potential use for 
hepatoprotective activity.

At the Faculties of Dentistry in Chiang Mai, Thailand (CM), and Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia (KL), 234 and 233 consecutive out-patients of mean ages 33.8 and 31.0 
yr, respectively, were examined for the presence of oral mucosal lesions. 
Tobacco in some form was regularly used by 31.7% and 27.5% of the study 
populations in CM and KL, respectively. Cigarette smoking was the predominant 
habit. In CM three persons chewed betel quids and nine smoked banana leaf cigars 
daily. In addition, there were 24 habitual chewers of tea leaves (miang). In KL 
six persons chewed betel quids daily. In CM and KL three cases each (1.3%) of 
tobacco-associated leukoplakias were found. In KL an additional idiopathic 
leukoplakia was registered. One and three cases of betel related lesions were 
found in CM and KL, respectively. One case of a squamous cell carcinoma was 
found in a 45-yr-old Indian woman in KL who had been chewing betel with tobacco 
daily for many years. High prevalence figures were found for lichen planus, 3.8% 
in CM and 2.1% in KL, and an extremely high one, 48.3%, in CM for episodes of 
aphthous ulcers experienced during the last 2 yr. Comparatively low prevalence 
figures were found for herpes labialis. As could be expected melanin 
pigmentation was prevalent while only low figures were encountered for 
denture-related lesions and amalgam tattoos.

India has one of the world's highest incidences of oral cancer. The habit of 
chewing betel quid is widespread and is suspected to play a role in the etiology 
of this disease. Studies in many other countries have also pointed to a role for 
human papilloma-viruses (HPVs) in the etiology of some oral cancers. In this 
study we analyzed biopsies from 91 Indian oral cancer patients, most of whom 
were betel quid chewers, by PCR amplification and direct DNA sequencing. HPV DNA 
was detected in 74% of these lesions, of which 41% had multiple HPV infections. 
Among the lesions from different oral sites, lesions of the tongue had the 
highest rate (9 of 11) of HPV infection. These HPV prevalences are among the 
highest ever reported in oral cancers. As to individual HPV types, prevalences 
of HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16 and HPV-18 were 13%, 20%, 42% and 47%, respectively. No 
additional known or novel HPV types were detected. To understand the 
unexpectedly high prevalences of the "low-risk" types HPV-6 and HPV-11, we 
compared the subtypes and variants that were found in oral cancers against those 
from benign genital warts from the same patient population but found no 
differences. The high prevalence of HPV in the oral cancers of these Indian 
patients suggests that viral infection is an important etiological component, 
with betel quid probably causing additional mutagenic steps in the carcinogenic 
process.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to observe the effects of the extract of Ginkgo biloba 
(EGb761) on the apoptosis of oxygen and glucose-deprived (OGD) human 
neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) cells and explore its mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SH-SY5Y cells were divided into normal control group, OGD 
group, OGD for 4 h and EGb761-pretreated groups including very low-concentration 
(20 μg/ml), low-concentration group (25 μg/ml), moderate-concentration group (50 
μg/ml) and high-concentration group (100 μg/ml). Twenty four hours after 
reoxygenation, cell viability was determined with 3-[4, 
5-dimehyl-2-thiazolyl]-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay, apoptosis 
rate was detected with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide 
double staining flow cytometry and the protein level of apoptosis-inducing 
factor (AIF) was observed with immunofluorescence technique in each group.
RESULTS: Cell viability was significantly lower in OGD group than in 
EGb761-pretreated groups, especially in moderate-concentration group (50 μg/ml) 
(P < 0.005). Apoptosis rate was significantly lower in EGb761-pretreated groups 
than in OGD group (P < 0.001). Immunofluorescent staining showed that there was 
AIF nuclear translocation in both EGb761-pretreated groups and OGD group, but 
AIF nuclear translocation was less in EGb761-pretreated groups than in OGD 
group.
CONCLUSION: EGb761 can reduce the apoptosis of OGD SH-SY5Y cells probably 
through inhibiting AIF nuclear translocation. This study provides a theoretical 
basis for the application of EGb761 in clinical practice.

Considerable attention has been focused on plants which are sources of natural 
anti-oxidant compounds, because most of them have a modulatory role on 
physiological functions and biotransformation reactions involved in the 
detoxification process. Such compounds are likely to afford protection from 
cytotoxic, genotoxic and metabolic actions of environmental toxicant thereby 
reducing the risk for cancer. The present study reports the anticarcinogenic 
activity of Swertia chirata Buch.Ham, an Indian medicinal plant. All the four 
detoxification enzymes studied viz, GST, GPx, SOD and CAT were found to be 
activated in different degrees following treatment with infusion of Swertia 
chirata, its crude extract and a purified 'Amarogentin' rich extract. The 
activation of the enzymes was accompanied by significant reduction in lipid 
peroxidation and inhibition of incidence as well as multiplicity of 
Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced papillomas. The effect of S.chirata on 
apoptosis and cell proliferation was also studied in mice skin exposed to DMBA. 
Both the crude and purified extracts significantly inhibited cell proliferation 
and induced apoptosis. This is the fi rst report of its kind and the observation 
suggests the chemopreventive potential of Swertia chirata.

Total five plants, three from Mizoram (Dillenia pentagyna, Ageratum conyzoides, 
Blumea lanceolaria) and two from Meghalaya (Potentilla fulgens, Taxus baccata) 
were studied for their antitumour activity against murine ascites Dalton's 
lymphoma (DL) in vivo. Only three plants showed the different magnitude of 
antitumour activity. Out of these three plants, the antitumour activity was 
maximally observed with the methanol extract of the stem bark of D. pentagyna as 
compared to the aqueous extract of the roots of A. conyzoides and aqueous 
extract of the root of P. fulgens. An increase in glutathione levels in Dalton's 
lymphoma cells was observed during tumour growth. Changes in glutathione and 
protein levels were also investigated in the liver and Dalton's lymphoma cells 
of tumour-bearing mice following the treatment with the extract of D. pentagyna 
which showed the highest antitumour activity as compared to the other two plant 
extracts. Glutathione in the liver and DL cells of treated tumour-bearing mice 
was found to be decreased. The protein concentration in liver and DL cells 
decreased mainly at 96 hr of treatment. It may be concluded that the natural 
product of D. pentagyna promises to be more active against Dalton's lymphoma 
than others and the decrease in glutathione level may be one of the important 
steps in resulting this antitumour effect.

Is pan masala-containing tobacco carcinogenic?

Chaudhry K(1).

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Pan masala-containing tobacco (PM-T) was introduced in the Indian 
market during the 1970s. It is a mixture of areca nut, tobacco, lime, catechu 
and spices. Despite mounting evidence of health hazards of tobacco, tobacco 
manufacturers as well as policy-makers often seek evidence regarding the 
carcinogenicity of newer tobacco mixtures such as PM-T.
METHODS: All the studies on pan masala (with or without tobacco) listed on 
MEDLARS, and the studies known to the expert committee on the subject 
constituted by the Directorate General of Health Services, were reviewed. The 
studies on individual components and PM-T like substances were also reviewed. 
The interpretation of carcinogenicity of PM-T has been made, based on studies on 
(i) PM-T; (ii) PM-T like mixtures; and (iii) the effect of individual 
ingredients of PM-T and the likely effect of their combination.
RESULTS: Studies on Chinese hamster ovary cells and Ames test indicate that PM-T 
is mutagenic. There is limited evidence that it may be carcinogenic to animals. 
The proportion of areca nut and tobacco in PM-T is in between the proportion of 
these substances in two known tobacco-areca nut mixtures of India (Mainpuri 
tobacco and mawa). Studies on Mainpuri tobacco indicate that it is carcinogenic, 
while literature suggests an association between mawa use and oral submucous 
fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: Human studies on PM-T like mixtures and the limited studies on PM-T 
suggest that PM-T is likely to be carcinogenic.

A retrospective study (1983-1989) of oral squamous carcinomas and concomitant 
oral habits was undertaken in South African Indians from Natal. Information came 
from hospital records and interviews with patients, families and friends. There 
were 143 oral squamous carcinomas; these occurred in a ratio of 1:1,6 for men 
and women respectively. Squamous carcinomas of the cheek (buccal mucosa, 
alveolar sulcus and gingiva) occurred most frequently, especially in women 
(57/89--64%), while in men tongue cancer predominated (22/54--41%). Ninety-three 
per cent of women (83/87) and 17% of men (9/54) habitually chewed the areca nut. 
Thirty-nine of 57 women (68%) with cheek cancer and 21/25 (84%) with tongue 
cancer only chewed the nut (no tobacco, snuff or smoking). Analyses confirmed an 
association between nut chewing and cheek cancer. The odds ratio (OR) for oral 
cancer in women 25 years and older who only chewed the nut was 43,9 and the 
attributable risk (AR) 0,89 (89%). With tobacco the OR increases to 47,42 and 
the AR to 0,91 (91%). The data showed that the areca nut habit with or without 
tobacco use is important in the development of oral squamous carcinoma. 
Elimination of this habit can reduce the risk in these women substantially 
(89-91%) if all other factors remain the same.

The diets of 158 tobacco/betel quid-chewing women diagnosed with oral 
premalignant lesions and 155 quid-chewing but lesion-free controls, frequency 
matched for age, tobacco/betel habits, and socioeconomic status, were assessed 
using a food frequency survey. Index scores generated from the food frequency 
survey indicated that the mean levels of consumption for foods of animal origin 
(p < 0.001), total vegetables and fruit (p = 0.001), vegetables alone (p = 
0.006), fruits alone (p = 0.006), and green leafy vegetables (p = 0.015) were 
significantly lower in cases than in controls. The mean index score for 
cobalamin (vitamin B12) was lower in cases with a borderline significance (p = 
0.05), whereas the indexes for folate and carotene were not significantly 
different. The analysis of index scores estimating the number of 100-g servings 
per week of foods of animal origin [meat, eggs, milk, curd (yogurt), fish] 
consumed revealed that women who ate fewer servings were more likely to have 
premalignant lesions than those who ate more animal foods [odds ratio (OR) 3.38, 
95% confidence interval (CI) 2.07-5.54, p = 0.001]. The risk for low consumption 
of vegetables was not as significant as that for foods of animal origin. 
However, those eating low levels of vegetables and low levels of foods of animal 
origin were at the greatest risk for lesions (OR 5.38, 95% CI 1.72-22.17, p < 
0.05). In South Indian female tobacco/betel chewers, a diet deficient in foods 
of animal origin appears to be a more significant risk factor for oral 
premalignancy than is a diet deficient in fruits and vegetables.

The effect of aqueous extract of Withania somnifera (L. Solanaceae) was studied 
against paclitaxel induced neutropenia in mice. After paclitaxel 1 mg/kg, i.v. 
administration significant fall in total WBC and absolute neutrophil count was 
observed on day 3 and day 5. W. Somnifera (200 mg/kg, p.o.) per se produced 
significant increase in neutrophil counts. W. somnifera (200 mg/kg, p.o.) when 
administered for 4 days before paclitaxel treatment and continued for 12 days 
caused significant reversal of neutropenia of paclitaxel. The findings of the 
study suggest the potential of W. somnifera as an adjuvant during cancer 
chemotherapy for the prevention of bone marrow depression associated with 
anticancer drugs.

The CH3OH-CH2Cl2 extract of an Indian collection (entire plant) of Gynandropsis 
gynandra (L.) Briq. was separated based on bioassay results employing cancer 
cell lines. Six cancer cell growth inhibitors were isolated and found to be 
known flavone apegenin (4) and flavonols 1-3, 5, and 6. The structure of 
flavonol 2 was confirmed by X-ray crystal structure determination. All of the 
five flavonols (1-3, 5, 6) inhibited the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell 
line with ED50 values of 3.0, 9.2, 4.0, 0.37, and 3.9 microg/ml, respectively. 
All six of the flavonoids (1-6) also exhibited activity against a panel of six 
human cancer cell lines. Penduletin (3) inhibited growth of the Gram-negative 
pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae and apegenin (4) inhibited growth of the 
Gram-positive opportunist Enterococcus faecalis.

Chromosome-damaging activity of saliva of betel nut and tobacco chewers.

Stich HF, Stich W.

Saliva of volunteers chewing betel quid, cured betel nut (Areca catechu), betel 
leaves (Piper betle), a mixture of quid ingredients (dried betel nut flakes, 
catechu, cardamon, lime, copra and menthol) and Indian tobacco was collected and 
examined for its genotoxic activity. Chromosome aberrations (chromatid breaks 
and chromatid exchanges) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used to 
estimate the genotoxic effect. No detectable levels of clastogenic activity were 
observed in the saliva of non-chewing individuals. After 5 min of chewing betel 
quid, betel nut, betel leaves, quid ingredients and Indian tobacco, the saliva 
samples showed relatively potent clastogenic activities. The addition of 
transition metals Mn2+ and Cu2+ to the saliva samples of betel nut and Indian 
tobacco chewers enhanced their clastogenic activities, whereas Fe3+ increased 
the clastogenicity of the betel nut saliva but decreased the genotoxic effect of 
the saliva of Indian tobacco chewers. After removal of the betel quid or its 
components from the mouth, the clastogenic activity disappeared within 5 min. 
The western-type chewing tobacco did not produce a genotoxic activity in the 
saliva of chewers. A possible association between the genotoxicity in the saliva 
of betel quid chewers and the development of oral, pharyngeal and esophageal 
carcinomas is discussed.

The activity of thymidylate synthase (TS) purified in our laboratory from 
Lactobacillus leichmannii was inhibited by pergularinine (PGL) and 
tylophorinidine (TPD) and deoxytubulosine (DTB) isolated from the Indian 
medicinal plants Pergularia pallida and Alangium lamarckii respectively. 
Cytotoxicity studies showed that cell growth of L. leichmannii was inhibited 
(IC50 = 40-45 microM) by all the three alkaloids, the concentrations > 80-90 
microM resulting in complete loss of the enzyme activity. Ki values of the 
enzyme calculated from Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots for PGL, TPD and DTB were 
10 x 10(-6) M, 9 x 10(-6) M and 7 x 10(-6) M respectively. These are typed as 
'non-competitive' inhibitors of TS. All the three alkaloids inhibited (IC50 = 50 
microM) the elevated TS activity of leukocytes in cancer patients with 
clinically diagnosed chronic myelocytic leukemia (n = 10), acute lymphocytic 
leukemia (n = 8) and metastatic solid tumours (n = 3).

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed noncutaneous cancer and 
the leading cause of cancer related deaths in men in the United States and many 
other Asian countries. Dietary factors are considered as a strategic agent to 
control the risk of PCa. Lupeol, a triterpene, present in fruits and medicinal 
plants, has been shown to possess many pharmacological properties including 
anticancer effects. Here, effect of lupeol on cell proliferation and cell death 
was evaluated using human PCa cells, PC-3. In MTT assay, lupeol inhibited the 
cell proliferation (12-71%) in dose (50-800 microM) and time dependent manner. 
Flow-cytometric analysis of cell-cycle revealed that an antiproliferative effect 
of lupeol (400-600 microM) is associated with an increase in G(2)/M-phase arrest 
(34-58%). RT-PCR analysis showed that lupeol-induced G2/M-phase arrest was 
mediated through the inhibition of cyclin regulated signaling pathway. Lupeol 
inhibited the expression of cyclin B, cdc25C, and plk1 but induced the 
expression of 14-3-3sigma genes. However no changes were observed in the 
expression of gadd45, p21(waf1/cip1) and cdc2 genes. Results of western blot 
showed that lupeol regulates the phosphorylation of cdc2 (Tyr15) and cdc25C 
(Ser198). Further, on increase of lupeol exposure to PC-3 cells an induction of 
apoptosis was recorded, which was associated with upregulation of bax, 
caspase-3, -9, and apaf1 genes and down regulation of antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene. 
The role of caspase-induced apoptosis was confirmed by increase in reactive 
oxygen species, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential followed by DNA 
fragmentation. Thus, our study suggests that lupeol possess novel 
antiproliferative and apoptotic potential against PCa.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The bark of Tecomella undulata is primarily used 
in the treatment of syphilis, painful swellings and cancer by traditional 
healers. Also, it is claimed to be useful in treating urinary discharges, 
enlargement of spleen, leucorrhoea, leukoderma, tumors, liver disorders, 
gonorrhea, gout and promotes wound healing in Indian traditional system of 
medicine.
AIM: To establish a scientific validation for the antitumor effects of Tecomella 
undulata bark and explore the mechanistic pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia 
cell line, K562. The study was further extended to standardize the extract using 
quercetin as biomarker.
METHODS: Induction of apoptosis by chloroform extract of Tecomella undulata bark 
(CTUB) was determined by MTT, Annexin V and caspase activation assays. The cell 
cycle analysis was done by flow cytometer and nuclear staining by DAPI. The 
standardization of the extract was performed through reverse phase-HPLC method 
under PDA detection.
RESULT: Results clearly showed the induction of apoptosis by CTUB in K562 cells. 
The effect was found to be dose dependent, having IC(50) of 30 μg/ml with 
activation of FAS, FADD, caspase 8, caspase 3/7 and fragmentation of DNA. The 
bioactive CTUB was determined to possess 0.03% (w/w) of quercetin.
CONCLUSION: The investigation clearly demonstrated the potential antitumor 
effect of CTUB, thereby validating the traditional claim. Quercetin, known to 
have anticancer activity is being reported and quantified for the first time 
from the bark of Tecomella undulata.

Exploration of the frontiers of tradomedical practices: basis for development of 
alternative medical healthcare services in developing countries.

The study is a brief exploration of the functions and roles of the traditional 
healers in the total health care delivery system as a basis for tapping the 
salient features of this age old art: for the purpose of refining, and 
establishing it as an alternative medical health-care service. The investigation 
is considered relevant particularly in the developing countries where, in 
addition to the dearth of orthodox medical services, institutions and personnel, 
it is relatively cheaper, socio-culturally accessible and acceptable. Refining 
and developing some aspects of the traditional healers' services will serve the 
interest of the health consumers whose main concern is with service and not the 
source. Furthermore, it is hoped that the study will stimulate purposeful 
discussions on the need for an unbiased examination of the materials, methods 
and techniques of the traditional healers including, eventually, compiling a 
native pharmacopoeia. A more comprehensive account of the traditional healers 
contributions to the battle against diseases and maintenance of health and well 
being is envisaged.

PIP: In traditional healing, practitioners use barks, leaves, nuts, fruit juices 
and roots, and parts of domestic animals. They practice their craft mostly in 
Africa, Asia, and other Third World countries, and they are variously called 
juju priests, diviners, herbalists, and witch doctors. Cases of achievements in 
their contributions to preventive and curative health have been documented. In 
Nigeria, clients regularly patronize both orthodox and traditional medical 
practitioners. Their remedies include healing the bite of the very poisonous 
carpet viper, chronic bronchitis, peptic ulcer, and heart problems, as well as 
performing uvulectomy and tonsillectomy. Quinine, the cure for malaria, was 
originally the ritual medicine of the Incas of Peru. It was confirmed that 
Azadirachta Indica (Meliaceae), the neem tree, used against malaria in Nigeria, 
India, and Asia, had a potent antiplasmodial activity. The plant Streblus asper, 
Linn (Shakhotoha Siora) is well known in Indian Ayurvedic medicine to treat 
fever, filariasis, dysentery, and diarrhea. The alkaloids derived from the 
Madagascan periwinkle Catharanthus roseus (Apocynaceae), used in a West Indian 
remedy for diabetes mellitus, have antitumor activity. The drug Maytensine, 
obtained from Mytenus ovatus Loes (Celastraceae), was found to be a powerful 
antitumor agent in animals. Tea made from the leaves of Osyris wightiana 
stimulated the flow of breast milk and also acted as a labor-inducing agent. 
Saponaria officinalis and Enterobbium cyclocarpum are both used in Egypt and 
Tanzania as spermicide contraceptives. A 1985 survey in Cross River State, 
Nigeria, demonstrated that 165 (61%) of respondents went to traditional healers 
for treatment. Part of their continued popularity is the person-centered 
approach that is virtually lacking in orthodox hospitals, although this 
humanistic approach to therapy is gradually gaining inroads into Western medical 
education. The services of both kinds of medicine could be harmonized by 
open-minded appraisal, identification of positive aspects, and acceptance of 
their complimentary nature.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of deaths in women globally. Present 
communication deals with design and synthesis of a few diarylnaphthyls as 
possible anti-breast cancer agents. Among the thirty three representatives with 
significant antiproliferative activity compounds 23 and 50 were quite 
efficacious against human breast cancer cells. Compound 50 induced apoptosis in 
both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and exerted S phase and G2/M phase arrest 
respectively via distinct mechanistic pathways. It showed moderate microtubule 
destabilization. Further, it exhibited DNA topoisomerase-II inhibition effect in 
MCF-7 cells. It was well tolerable and found safe up to 300 mg/kg dose in Swiss 
albino mice. The dual action antiproliferative effect of compound 50 is quite 
interesting and warrants for future development.

BACKGROUND: Betel quid chewing is a common habit widely practiced in Southern 
Asian populations. However, variations are seen in the content of a betel quid 
across the different countries. Factors associated with commencement and 
cessation of this habit has been numerously studied. Unfortunately, data on 
Malaysian population is non-existent. This study aims to determine the factors 
associated with the inception and also cessation of betel quid chewing behaviour 
among Malaysian adults.
METHOD: This study is part of a nationwide survey on oral mucosal lesions 
carried out among 11,697 adults in all fourteen states in Malaysia. The 
questionnaire included sociodemographic information and details on betel quid 
chewing habit such as duration, type and frequency. The Kaplan-Meier estimates 
were calculated and plotted to compare the rates for the commencement and 
cessation of betel quid chewing behaviour. Cox proportional hazard regression 
models were used to calculate the hazard rate ratios for factors related to 
commencement or cessation of this habit.
RESULTS: Of the total subjects, 8.2% were found to be betel quid chewers. This 
habit was more prevalent among females and, in terms of ethnicity, among the 
Indians and the Indigenous people of Sabah and Sarawak. Cessation of this habit 
was more commonly seen among males and the Chinese. Females were found to be 
significantly more likely to start (p < 0.0001) and less likely to stop the quid 
chewing habit. Females, those over 40 years old, Indians and a history of 
smoking was found to significantly increase the likelihood of developing a quid 
chewing habit (p < 0.0001). However, those who had stopped smoking were found to 
be significantly more likely to promote stopping the habit (p = 0.0064). 
Cessation was also more likely to be seen among those who chewed less than 5 
quids per day (p < 0.05) and less likely to be seen among those who included 
areca nut and tobacco in their quid (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Factors that influence the development and cessation of this 
behaviour are gender, age, ethnicity, and also history of smoking habit while 
frequency and type of quid chewed are important factors for cessation of this 
habit.

Three cytogenetic endpoints were studied in non-chewing healthy controls and 3 
groups of tobacco-areca nut chewers, viz. normal chewers, chewers with oral 
submucous fibrosis and chewers with oral cancer. Frequencies of sister-chromatid 
exchanges and chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes and of 
micronucleated cells in exfoliated buccal mucosa were evaluated. All the 
parameters showed statistically significant elevations in all 3 groups of 
chewers compared to the controls. The data indicate possible application of the 
parameters as sensitive endpoints for monitoring tobacco-areca nut chewers, the 
group of individuals at higher risk of developing oral cancer, the commonest 
cancer among Indian males.

Withaferin A induces apoptosis by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase signaling cascade in leukemic cells of lymphoid and myeloid origin 
through mitochondrial death cascade.

Withaferin A (WA) is present abundantly in Withania somnifera, a well-known 
Indian medicinal plant. Here we demonstrate how WA exhibits a strong 
growth-inhibitory effect on several human leukemic cell lines and on primary 
cells from patients with lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia in a dose-dependent 
manner, showing no toxicity on normal human lymphocytes and primitive 
hematopoietic progenitor cells. WA-mediated decrease in cell viability was 
observed through apoptosis as demonstrated by externalization of 
phosphatidylserine, a time-dependent increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio; loss of 
mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspases 9 and 3 
activation; and accumulation of cells in sub-G0 region based on DNA 
fragmentation. A search for the downstream pathway further reveals that 
WA-induced apoptosis was mediated by an increase in phosphorylated p38MAPK 
expression, which further activated downstream signaling by phosphorylating 
ATF-2 and HSP27 in leukemic cells. The RNA interference of p38MAPK protected 
these cells from WA-induced apoptosis. The RNAi knockdown of p38MAPK inhibited 
active phosphorylation of p38MAPK, Bax expression, activation of caspase 3 and 
increase in Annexin V positivity. Altogether, these findings suggest that 
p38MAPK in leukemic cells promotes WA-induced apoptosis. WA caused increased 
levels of Bax in response to MAPK signaling, which resulted in the initiation of 
mitochondrial death cascade, and therefore it holds promise as a new, 
alternative, inexpensive chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of patients 
with leukemia of both lymphoid and myeloid origin.

A review of research related to oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) among South 
Africans of Indian descent shows a certain uniqueness compared to other 
countries. In South Africa the betel habit is more common among women, only 60% 
of chewers prefer the betel quid while the rest like the nut by itself, the 
majority of chewers prefer the baked (black) nut variety and a minority add 
tobacco to their chew. This pattern reflects in the distribution of OSF and the 
practice of the habit by OSF subjects. Compared to chewers without OSF, OSF 
subjects are younger and have shorter histories of chewing. Yet the profile of 
systemic diseases were similar among subjects with and without OSF. The habit as 
practised in South Africa also determines the pattern of oral squamous 
carcinomas. They are more common in women, with buccal mucosa cancers being the 
most frequent. The latter are commonly found in subjects not using any tobacco, 
indicating the carcinogenicity of the areca nut. It was also shown that oral 
cancer can develop in chewers without an intermediate precancerous OSF phase. A 
follow-up of OSF cases after cessation of the habit revealed that once present 
the disease is permanent. An analysis of cultured OSF fibroblasts demonstrated a 
permanent shift to larger cells theoretically capable of producing larger 
amounts of collagen. Thus the agents in the nut could be the initiators of the 
disease and its permanent character the result of a phenotypic alteration in 
cells from changes in gene expression.

ING1, a recently identified candidate tumor suppressor gene, involved in the p53 
signaling pathway is mapped at chromosome 13q34. Since loss of heterozygosity at 
13q34 has been reported in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, we screened 
for mutations in ING1 by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation 
polymorphism in 71 oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) from India, 15 of which 
were known to harbor p53 mutations. A single polymorphism (G to A) was detected 
in 14 (19.7%) of the tumors analyzed. No mutation was observed in any of the 71 
OSCCs analyzed. These results suggest that ING1 is not a target for mutational 
inactivation in OSCC of Indians.

Bioassay (P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line and human tumor cell lines)-guided 
separation of the extracts prepared from the tropical and coastal trees 
Hernandia peltata (Malaysia) and Hernandianymphaeifolia (Republic of Maldives) 
led to the isolation of a new lignan designated as hernanol (1) and 12 
previously known lignans: (-)-deoxypodophyllotoxin (2), deoxypicropodophyllin 
(3), (+)-epiaschantin (4), (+)-epieudesmin (5), praderin (6), 5'-methoxyyatein 
(7), podorhizol (8), deoxypodorhizone (9), bursehernin (10), kusunokinol (11), 
clusin (12), and (-)-maculatin (13). The oxidative cyclization (with VOF(3)) of 
lignans 8, 9, and 10 resulted in a new and unusual benzopyran (14), isostegane 
(15), and a new dibenzocyclooctadiene lactone (16), respectively. The structure 
and relative stereochemistry of hernanol (1) and lignans 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 
12 were determined by 1D and 2DNMR and HRMS analyses. The structures and 
absolute stereochemistry of structures 2, 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, and 16 were 
unequivocally determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. 
Evaluation against the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line and human 
tumor cell lines showed podophyllotoxin derivatives 2 and 3 to be strong cancer 
cell line growth inhibitors and substances 4, 5, 8, and 15 to have marginal 
cancer cell line inhibitory activities. Seven of the lignans and one of the 
synthetic modifications (14) inhibited growth of the pathogenic bacterium 
Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

Extracts from certain Mexican Indian medicinal plants used in traditional 
indigenous medicine for the treatment of inflammations contain sequiterpene 
lactones (SLs), which specifically inhibit the transcription factor NF-kappa B 
(Bork, P. M., Schmitz, M. L., Kuhnt, M., Escher, C., and Heinrich, M. (1997) 
FEBS Lett. 402, 85-90). Here we show that SLs prevented the activation of 
NF-kappa B by different stimuli such as phorbol esters, tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha, ligation of the T-cell receptor, and hydrogen peroxide in various 
cell types. Treatment of cells with SLs prevented the induced degradation of I 
kappa B-alpha and I kappa B-beta by all these stimuli, suggesting that they 
interfere with a rather common step in the activation of NF-kappa B. SLs did 
neither interfere with DNA binding activity of activated NF-kappa B nor with the 
activity of the protein tyrosine kinases p59fyn and p60arc. Micromolar amounts 
of SLs prevented the induced expression of the NF-kappa B target gene 
intracellular adhesion molecule 1. Inhibition of NF-kappa B by SLs resulted in 
an enhanced cell killing of murine fibroblast cells by tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha. SLs lacking an exomethylene group in conjugation with the lactone 
function displayed no inhibitory activity on NF-kappa B. The analysis of the 
cellular redox state by fluorescence-activated cell sorter showed that the SLs 
had no direct or indirect anti-oxidant properties.

An alternative pathogenetic pathway for oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF).

Oral submucous fibrosis is a potent pre-cancerous condition which occurs almost 
exclusively in Indians but cases have been reported from several countries. The 
definite aetiology of OSMF is still unknown and there is no known treatment for 
it. Chilles, tobacco use, vitamin deficiencies and betel quid chewing have been 
implicated. Ramanathan is of the view that OSMF seems to be the Asian version of 
sideropenic dysphagia. He suggests that OSMF appears to be an altered oral 
mucosa following prolonged period of chronic deficiency of iron and/or vitamin 
"B" complex especially folic acid. This changed state of the oral mucosa 
subsequently appears to develop more easily a hypersensitivity to oral irritants 
such as spices especially chillies and to the betel quid. We hold that the 
hypersensitivity caused by local irritants and the resultant persistent juxta 
epithelial inflammatory response noted in OSMF (in a host system already primed 
by an intrinsic genetic defect) act as the initiating factor leading to a 
defective inflammatory--reparative response, culminating in fibrotic healing. 
The role of iron and "B"complex together with others may be contributory 
(promotor) to this pre-existing pathologic response of the lamina propria.

Of the three main races of Singapore, Malays and Indians are less susceptible to 
gastric and colorectal carcinoma and peptic ulcer when compared with Chinese. 
Racial differences in dietary habits include a smaller amount of chilli consumed 
by the Chinese when compared with the other two races. Chilli may be expected to 
accelerate gastrointestinal transit and hence to inhibit colonic carcinogenesis, 
while its active ingredient capsaicin protects against experimental gastric 
mucosal injury. The effect of chilli consumption was studied in relation to: (i) 
gastrointestinal crypt cell production rate and nucleic acid content as indices 
of mucosal proliferation, which is related to the risk of development of 
gastrointestinal cancer and peptic ulcer; and (ii) azoxymethane-induced 
intestinal cancer. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 102) received either standard 
powdered chow or chow supplemented with 100 or 200 mg of chilli powder daily for 
1, 18 or 24 weeks. Gastric, small-bowel and colonic crypt cell production rates 
were studied at all three time periods, while mucosal DNA, RNA and protein 
contents were measured at 1 and 24 weeks. While crypt cell production rates were 
unaffected by chilli ingestion, mucosal contents of nucleic acid and protein 
were mostly increased in chilli-fed animals compared to controls, especially in 
the colon at 24 weeks. A further 99 rats received subcutaneous injections of 
either azoxymethane 15 mg/kg/week x 6 or sterile water and were randomized to 
the same three dietary groups for 26 weeks. The number, size and location of 
benign and malignant duodenal and colonic tumours were unaffected by chilli 
intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Barringtonia racemosa has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment 
of various diseases. The antitumor property of the seed extract of this plant in 
mice model promotes us to search for the active component present in the fruit 
extract. Quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (QOR) has been isolated from the fruits of 
this plant for the first time and quantified by HPLC method. The compound was 
identified by IR, mass, and NMR (1D, 2D) spectral data analysis. QOR showed 
dose- and time-dependent anti-proliferative activity in several leukemic cell 
lines with negligible effect on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
(PBMC). A representative T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line 
(MOLT-3) showed phosphatidyl serine externalization and DNA fragmentation, 
indicating QOR-induced programmed cell death. We established that QOR-induced 
apoptosis occurred preferentially on accumulation of cells in the sub-G(0) phase 
and genomic DNA fragmentation through the activation of mitochondria-dependent 
caspase cascade for the first time in T-lineage ALL cell line.

Devil's Club, Oplopanax horridus (OH), is a widely used folk medicine in Alaska 
and British Columbia for treating a variety of ailments including arthritis, 
fever and diabetes. HPLC profiling shows that numerous compounds are present in 
the 70% ethanolic extract of OH dry root bark powder. OH extract inhibited K562, 
HL60, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cell growth with the 50% inhibition (IC(50)) estimated 
at 1/2700, 1/1700, 1/500 and 1/2500 dilutions, respectively. Non-cytotoxic 
concentrations (<IC(50)) of OH extract combined with non-cytotoxic 
concentrations (<IC(50)) of camptothecin (CAM) or paclitaxel (PTX) were tested 
on the tumor cell lines. Of the 19 combinations tested, 9 showed additive or 
synergistic anti-proliferative effect while the rest showed antagonistic effect. 
Combination of OH extract at 1/4000 and 1/16,000 dilutions with 0.1 microM of 
CAM produced additive, anti-proliferative effects on K562 cells, as did 1/2000 
and 1/1000 dilutions of OH combined with 2.5 nM of PTX on MCF7, and 1/4000 
dilution of OH with 1 nM of PTX on MDA-MB-468 cells. Combination of 1/8000 and 
1/4000 dilution of OH with 0.05 microM of CAM showed strong synergistic 
anti-proliferative effects on HL60 cells. At non-cytotoxic 1/4000 dilution, OH 
induced 13.1% of HL60 cells to differentiate into granulocytes but had no effect 
on monocyte/macrophage differentiation. A cell free hydroxyl radical scavenging 
assay estimated that OH at 1/100, 1/10 and 1/5 dilutions showed activities 
equivalent to 2.7, 15.7 and 25.6 microM of Trolox, respectively. At 
non-cytotoxic 1/4000 and 1/2000 dilutions, OH significantly reduced nitric oxide 
production by lipopolysaccharide activated RAW 264.7 cells (p<0.001). Our data 
show that the ethanolic extract of OH has anti-proliferative on several cancer 
cell lines, and has strong antioxidant activity.

A new cancer cell growth inhibitor designated pedilstatin (1) was isolated from 
a Republic of Maldives Pedilanthus sp. The structure was determined to be 
13-O-acetyl-12-O-[2'Z,4'E-octadienoyl]-4alpha-deoxyphorbol on the basis of 
high-resolution mass spectral and 2D NMR assignments. Pedilstatin was found to 
significantly inhibit growth of the P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line with an 
ED(50) of 0.28 microg/mL, to afford, at concentrations of 2-5 microM, protection 
(to 80%) of human-derived lymphoblastoid CEM-SS cells from infection and 
cell-killing by HIV-1, and to show inhibition of protein kinase C with a K(i) of 
620 +/- 20 nM.

In vitro immunostimulatory effect of Abrus lectins derived peptide fractions 
(AGP and ABP) was investigated in DL bearing mice. Both AGP and ABP were found 
to activate splenocytes and induced production of cytokines like IL-2, IFN-gamma 
and TNF-alpha indicating a Th1 type of immune response. Analysis of in vitro 
treated splenocytes by flow cytometry revealed an increase in percentage of T 
and B cell with high expression of activation markers (CD25(+) and CD71(+)). At 
the same time, expression of co-stimulatory markers was significantly high 
compared to tumor control. The tumor associated macrophages were able to 
stimulate NO production, IL-1 secretion, increased phagocytosis and decreased 
expression of mannose receptor. It was also observed that NK cell was activated 
by AGP and ABP. These results suggest that both AGP and ABP act as 
immunostimulants in vitro in DL bearing mice.

Alexander cell line, an human hepatocellular carcinoma derived cell line which 
has the property of secreting HBsAg in the supernatant was used to study the 
antiviral property of phyllanthus amarus. Aquous extract of Phyllanthus amarus 
was evaluated for its in vitro ability to inhibit HBsAg secretion on a dose 
dependent manner. It was seen that P. amarus at 1mg/ml concentration on a single 
dose inhibited the secretion of HBsAg for a period of 48 hours. This experiment 
proved the anti hepatitis B virus property of P. amarus at cellular level and 
further confirmed its beneficial use in the treatment of acute and chronic 
hepatitis B and healthy carriers of HBV.

The antineoplastic effect of Trigonella foenum graecum seed extract has been 
evaluated in the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) model in Balb-C mice. 
Intra-peritoneal administration of the alcohol extract of the seed both before 
and after inoculation of EAC cell in mice produced more than 70% inhibition of 
tumour cell growth with respect to the control. Treatment with the extract was 
found to enhance both the peritoneal exudate cell and macrophage cell counts. 
The extract also produced a significant antiinflammatory effect. We report here 
the antiinflammatory and antineoplastic effects, of Trigonella foenum graecum 
seed extract.

From the petroleum ether extract of the root bark of Salacia Oblonga wall, two 
biologically active fractions have been isolated by column and thin layer 
chromatography. The methanol eluted fraction of the extract absorbed on a column 
of silica gel at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml showed 100 percent 
cytotoxicity on Ehrlich ascites tumour cells. The chloroform eluted fraction of 
the pet. ether extract and a fluorescent compound separated from it by TLC 
demonstrated about 60% and 76% hypoglycemic potency of an equal dose of 
tolbutamide (250 mg/kg) in albino rats. The results indicate the therapeutic 
importance of S. Oblonga wall.

Prognostic significance of p53 protein overexpression in betel- and 
tobacco-related oral oncogenesis.

We have previously reported overexpression of p53 protein in tobacco-related 
oral dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the Indian population. A 
follow-up study was carried out to determine the prognostic significance of an 
accumulation of p53 protein during oral tumorigenesis. One hundred and two of 
145 (70%) of oral SCCs and 39/75 (52%) of oral dysplasias showed overexpression 
of p53 protein, while only 3 of 107 (3%) normal oral tissues showed a detectable 
level of the protein. Follow-up studies of these patients suggest that an 
accumulation of p53 protein may be involved in the early phases of oral SCC 
development and indicate the predisposition of a particular premalignant lesion 
towards malignancy. In patients with premalignant lesions, the median transition 
time (premalignancy to malignancy) was significantly shorter in p53 positive 
cases than in p53 negative cases (p = 0.013). Among the oral cancer patients, 
univariate analysis showed that alteration in p53 expression was associated with 
significantly decreased disease-free survival. The p53 positive cases showed 
decreased median disease-free survival time (no recurrence/metastasis) compared 
with the p53 negative cases (p = 0.013), indicating that p53 accumulation may 
serve as a prognostic indicator in oral cancer patients.

Oral submucous fibrosis is a high risk precancerous condition and is suggested 
to be caused by areca nut chewing. Areca nut chewing is popular in Hunan 
Province of China, and is more concentrated in Xiangtan City. Two and nine cases 
of oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) were first noticed in 1984 and 1985 
respectively, and an epidemiologic survey was subsequently performed in 1986. 
The epidermiologic method of cluster sampling was used. The Yuhu District, one 
of the five urban districts of the Xiangtan City with a population of 100,000 
was selected as a whole body in the survey, 57 independent units of various 
professions were randomly selected as group samples and more than 70% of 
subjects in each unit were examined. Definite fibrous band on palpation was used 
as a main diagnostic criterion for OSF. A total of 11046 individuals were 
examined; among them were 3907 areca nut chewers (35.37%) and 7139 non-chewers 
(64.63%). 335 cases of OSF were found, comprising a prevalence rate of 3.03%. 
The disease involved mainly the middle third of the oral cavity. All of the OSF 
cases were areca nut chewers. No case had been found in non-chewers. Four cases 
of oral carcinoma were found on the basis of OSF, the malignant transformation 
rate was 1.19%. The high prevalence of OSF may be due to areca nut chewing plus 
extensive and heavy use of hot pepper in Xiangtan people. The result supports 
the role of the areca nut as an etiologic factor in the development of OSF. The 
low malignant transformation rate of 1.19% compared with the 7.6% in an Indian 
report may be because Xiangtan people chew areca nut without tobacco.

Natural products discovered from medicinal plants have played an important role 
in the treatment of cancer. In an effort to identify novel small molecules which 
can affect the proliferation of lymphoma cells, we tested methyl angolensate 
(MA), a plant derived tetranortriterpenoid, purified from the crude extract of 
the root callus of Soymida febrifuga commonly known as Indian red wood tree. We 
have tested MA for its cytotoxic properties on Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, 
using various cellular assays. We observed that MA induces cytotoxicity in Daudi 
cells in a dose-dependent manner using trypan blue, MTT and LDH assays. We find 
that the treatment with MA led to activation of DNA double-strand break repair 
proteins including KU70 and KU80, suggesting the activation of nonhomologous DNA 
end joining pathway in surviving cells. Further, we find that methyl angolensate 
could induce apoptosis by cell cycle analysis, annexin V-FITC staining, DNA 
fragmentation and PARP cleavage. Besides, MA treatment led to reactive oxygen 
species generation and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. These 
results suggest the activation of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Hence, we 
identify MA as a potential chemotherapeutic agent against Daudi cells.

Sciences, Delhi, India.

A significant antitumour effect of P. hexandrum, a herb thriving at Himalayas 
(2500-4000 m), was observed in strain 'A' mice carrying solid tumours developed 
by transplanting Ehrlich ascites tumour (EAT). Subtoxic well tolerated 
sequential doses of aqueous extract of P. hexandrum (a daily dose of 34.5 mg/kg 
b.w. for 15 days) enhanced tumour doubling time (TDT) from 1.94 +/- 0.26 days to 
19.1 +/- 2.5 days. However, no synergism was revealed between radiation and P. 
hexandrum, though both independently manifested antitumour effects. In normal 
mice, pre-irradiation administration of extract of P. hexandrum protected mice 
in a dose dependent manner (optimal dose being 34.5 mg/kg body.wt. rendering 72% 
survival for 30 days) against whole body lethal irradiation of 10 Gy. 
Radioprotective properties of P. hexandrum were found to be comparable to 
synthetic radioprotectors like diltiazem etc.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Glycosmis pentaphylla (Retz.) Correa is used in 
Indian traditional medicine against jaundice and other liver disorders.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aims to determine the in vitro anticancer and 
apoptosis inducing activity of Glycosmis pentaphylla in hepatocellular carcinoma 
cell line, Hep3 B.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing activity of the 
crude extract and active fractions were estimated on Hep3 B and RAW264.7 cell 
lines by MTT assay, Hoechst staining, DNA fragmentation, morphological studies, 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and 
anti-poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase assays. The phytochemical profiling of active 
extract was done by TLC and HPTLC methods.
RESULTS: Ethanol extract of Glycosmis pentaphylla was more effective than other 
extracts in reducing the proliferation of Hep3 B cells. As revealed by the 
results from DNA fragmentation, Hoechst staining, morphological studies, RT-PCR, 
PARP cleavage and gene expression studies, active extract induced apoptosis on 
Hep3 B cell line in concentration and time dependent manner with increase in the 
Bax/Bcl2 gene expression ratio. Chemo profiling data revealed the presence of 
flavonoid in the active fraction.
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that major active component in the ethanol extract 
of Glycosmis pentaphylla is a flavonoid which induces apoptosis on cancer cell 
line, Hep3 B, by increasing the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl2 genes in a time and 
dose dependent manner.

A chemical investigation of an ethyl acetate extract of the Red Sea soft coral 
Sarcophyton glaucum has led to the isolation of two peroxide diterpenes, 11(S) 
hydroperoxylsarcoph-12(20)-ene (1), and 12(S)-hydroperoxylsarcoph-10-ene (2), as 
well as 8-epi-sarcophinone (3). In addition to these three new compounds, two 
known structures were identified including: ent-sarcophine (4) and sarcophine 
(5). Structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, with the relative 
configuration of 1 and 2 confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Isolated compounds were 
found to be inhibitors of cytochrome P₄₅₀ 1A activity as well as inducers of 
glutathione S-transferases (GST), quinone reductase (QR), and epoxide hydrolase 
(mEH) establishing chemo-preventive and tumor anti-initiating activity for these 
characterized metabolites.

The chemopreventive efficacy of the Indian medicinal plant Trianthema 
portulacastrum L. Aizoaceae was tested in a chemical rat hepatocarcinogenesis 
model in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hepatocarcinogenesis was induced by the 
potent carcinogen diethylnitrosoamine (DENA). Treatment of the rats to the basal 
medium with aqueous, ethanolic and chloroform fractions of the plant extract at 
a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight once daily reduced the incidence, numerical 
preponderance, multiplicity and size distribution of visible neoplastic nodules. 
Morphometric evaluation of focal lesions showed a reduction of altered liver 
cell foci/cm2 and a reduction of the average focal area. A decrease in the 
percentage of liver parenchyma occupied by foci seems to suggest the 
anticarcinogenic potential of the plant extract in DENA-induced 
hepatocarcinogenesis.

Co-overexpression of p53 and c-myc proteins linked with advanced stages of

Epidemiological evidence suggests that heavy consumption of betel quid and 
tobacco with areca nuts is the cause of high incidence of oral cancer in eastern 
part of Indian population, which is distinctly different from the etiology of 
oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) in western countries. Here, expression of 
p53 and c-myc protein was studied in oral SCCs from this etiologically distinct 
population by immunohistochemistry. Out of 48 specimens of oral SCCs, 22 (45.8%) 
exhibited p53 positivity and 27 (56.3%) showed immunoreactivity with c-myc 
antibody. Considering the p53/c-myc expression pattern, either alone or in 
combination, the population was divided into four groups, i.e., both p53 and 
c-myc positive; p53 positive-c-myc negative; c-myc positive - p53 negative; and 
both p53 and c-myc negative. Tumours with both p53 and c-myc positivity were in 
advanced stages of the disease (poorly differentiated, tumour stage 3, nuclear 
grade III), whereas earliest stage of oral SCCs was detected in tumours with 
neither p53 nor c-myc immunoreactivity. Tumours of remaining two groups were 
generally restricted to early to moderate stages. These observations suggest 
that rapid progression of the betel- and tobacco-related oral SCCs may be 
associated with a simultaneous involvement of these two oncoproteins. The study 
also attempted to find out the relationship of p53/c-myc expression with 
spontaneous apoptosis. More apoptotic cells were found in c-myc positive but p53 
negative tumours. This preliminary observation requires further molecular 
investigation of the role of p53 and c-myc genes for the progression of this 
epidemiologically distinct oral carcinogenesis.

Dihydrofolate reductase and cell growth activity inhibition by the 
beta-carboline-benzoquinolizidine plant alkaloid deoxytubulosine from Alangium 
lamarckii: its potential as an antimicrobial and anticancer agent.

Beta-carboline-benzoquinolizidine plant alkaloid deoxytubulosine (DTB) was 
evaluated and assessed for the first time for its biochemical and biological 
activity employing the biomarker dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 
(5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate: NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) as the probe 
enzyme, a key target in cancer chemotherapy. DHFR, employed in the present 
investigations was purified from Lactobacillus leichmannii. DTB, isolated from 
the Indian medicinal plant Alangium lamarckii was demonstrated to exhibit potent 
cytotoxicity. The alkaloid potently inhibited the cell growth of L. leichmannii 
and the cellular enzyme activity of DHFR (IC50=40 and 30 microM for the cell 
growth and enzyme inhibitions, respectively). DTB concentrations >75 microM 
resulted in a total loss of the DHFR activity, thus suggesting that the 
beta-carboline-benzoquinolizidine plant alkaloid is a promising potential 
antitumor agent. Our results are also suggestive of its potential antimicrobial 
activity. DTB binding to DHFR appears to be slow and reversible. Inhibition 
kinetics revealed that DHFR has a Ki value of 5x10(-6) M for DTB and that the 
enzyme inhibition is a simple linear 'non-competitive' type.

Use of betel quid and cigarettes among Bangladeshi patients in an inner-city 
practice: prevalence and knowledge of health effects.

Ahmed S(1), Rahman A, Hull S.

(1)Steels Lane Health Centre, London.

BACKGROUND: Betel quid chewing, often combined with tobacco chewing, is a common 
habit in the Indian subcontinent. It is associated with the development of 
malignancy of the oral mucosa and foregut. Among Asian communities in the United 
Kingdom (UK), Bangladeshis are particularly likely to retain this habit.
AIM: To investigate the prevalence of betel quid chewing, smoking, and knowledge 
of health hazards associated with these habits among the Bangladeshi population 
in an east London general practice.
METHOD: A bilingual postal questionnaire to all 306 adults (25 years and over) 
identified as being of Bangladeshi origin within one practice in east London.
RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate was 46%. The prevalence of betel quid 
chewing was over 80% with no sex difference. Men were more likely to smoke 
tobacco than women (men = 57%, women = 11%, X2 = 33.3, P < 0.001), but over half 
the women added tobacco to their quid for chewing. Whereas over 80% of both male 
and female respondents identified the health risk of smoking, only one third 
identified oral cancer as a risk. In all, 25% of respondents started chewing in 
the UK.
CONCLUSIONS: The low response rate is discussed. The findings indicate that the 
majority of Bangladeshi respondents are unaware of the health risks of a common 
social habit, although well informed about smoking risks. A government health 
warning should be introduced for betel quid sold in the UK.

Withania somnifera is a medicinal plant used in the treatment of a variety of 
ailments in the Ayurvedic system. Alcoholic extract of the root of the plant was 
injected(ip) at daily doses of 200 to 1000 mg/kg body wt for 15 days starting 
from 24 hr after intradermal inoculation of 5 x 10(5) cells of S-180 in BALB/c 
mice. Solid tumor growth was monitored for 100 days. Doses of 400 mg/kg and 
above produced complete regression of tumor after an initial growth, the 
percentage of complete response (CR) increasing with increasing drug dose. A 55% 
CR was obtained at 1000 mg/kg drug administration, but this dose also produced 
some mortality among the animals. A significant increase in the volume doubling 
time and growth delay was seen when the drug dose was increased from 500 to 750 
mg/kg body wt, but further increase in drug dose to 1000 mg/kg did not produce 
any significant increase in these responses. Cumulative doses of 7.5 to 10 g at 
daily doses of 500 or 750 mg/kg seems to produce a good response in this tumor.

DMBA (195 nmol/50 microliters of acetone/animal) was applied topically over the 
dorsal skin of the mice and tumors were promoted by repeated applications of 
croton oil (1% in acetone, three times per week) after two weeks of DMBA 
application. Skin papillomas appeared in 100% animals in control as well as in 
groups treated orally with Liv. 52 at post-initiational stages and continuously 
at peri-initiational and post-initiational stages of papillomagenesis. When Liv. 
52 was given orally at the peri-initiational stage of papillomagenesis, the 
percentage of mice bearing tumors was 75% and the tumor mean per mouse was 
reduced to 4.0 +/- 1.63 as compared to 7.5 +/- 3.54 in the control group after 
15 weeks of observation. The tumor mean per mouse was observed to be 4.75 +/- 
0.55 and 2.5 +/- 0.57 in the groups treated orally with Liv. 52 at the 
post-initiational stages and continuously at peri-initiational and 
post-initiational stages of papillomagenesis respectively. Similarly, the 
cumulative number of papillomas after 15 weeks was 30 in the control group, 
which was reduced to 10 in the animals treated with Liv. 52 continuously at 
peri-initiational and post-initiational stages. The cumulative number of 
papillomas was also reduced to 16 and 19 in animals treated with Liv. 52 at 
peri-initiational and post-initiational stages, respectively.

Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been found to be the single most 
frequent event in human cancers. In India and other southeast Asian countries 
tobacco chewing with betel quid was attributed to be the major factor in oral 
carcinogenesis. We have analyzed 72 untreated primary oral squamous cell 
carcinomas (SCCs) for mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 exons 4-9 by 
PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing. Sequencing analysis revealed 16 missense mutations, 
one silent mutation in codon 307 and four A to G substitution polymorphism in 
codon 213. The incidence of p53 mutation was 21% (15 of 72) excluding the 
polymorphism and the silent mutation. Eight mutations were clustered in codons 
266-282 of exon 8. Of the total mutation events 37.5% were G to A transitions 
and 31.3% were G to T transversions. These results indicate the possible 
involvement of tobacco derived nitrosamines and their adducts in the genesis of 
oral cancer among Indians.

The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in Malaysia was determined by examining a 
representative sample of 11,707 subjects aged 25 years and above throughout the 
14 states over a period of 5 months during 1993/1994. A two-stage stratified 
random sampling was undertaken. A predetermined number of enumeration blocks, 
the smallest population unit in the census publication, was selected from each 
state. With the selected enumeration block, a systematic sample of living 
quarters was chosen with a random start. The survey instrument included a 
questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics and a clinical examination. 
The clinical examination was carried out by 16 specially trained dental public 
health officers and the diagnosis calibrated with a final concordance rate of 
92%. The age in the sample ranged from 25 to 115 years with a mean of 
44.5+/-14.0. The sample comprised 40.2% males and 59.8% females; 55.8% were 
Malays, 29.4% Chinese, 10.0% Indians and 1.2% other ethnic groups. Oral mucosal 
lesions were detected in 1131 (9.7%) subjects, 5 (0.04%) had oral cancer, 165 
(1.4%) had lesions or conditions that may be precancerous (leukoplakia, 
erythroplakia, submucous fibrosis and lichen planus) and 187 (1.6%) had betel 
chewer's mucosa. The prevalence of oral precancer was highest amongst Indians 
(4.0%) and other Bumiputras (the indigenous people of Sabah and Sarawak) (2.5%) 
while the lowest prevalence was amongst the Chinese (0.5%).

Petroleum ether extract from H. spinosa root exhibited antitumor activity in 
Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and Sarcoma-180 bearing mice Processed extract 
suppressed significantly the tumor fluid volume at the end of 3 weeks 
experiment. It decreased about 50% of packed cell volume and increased life span 
of EAC/S-180 bearing mice in a day dependent manner. Red blood cell count, 
hemoglobin content and white blood cell count were more or less normal after 
processed extract treatment of the tumor bearing mice. In tumor control animals, 
neutrophils increased (273.7% in EAC and 263.4% in S-180 bearing mice 
respectively with respect to normal mice) whereas lymphocytes decreased (60.0% 
in EAC and 56.5% in S-180 bearing mice respectively with respect to normal 
mice). It also inhibited the rapid increase of body weight of tumor bearing 
mice.

Toxicological study of Semecarpus anacardium nut extract.

Kesava Rao KV, Gothoskar SV, Chitnis MP, Ranadive KJ.

Toxicological study was carried out in rats with chloroform-soluble fraction of 
the nuts of Semecarpus anacardium to determine its safe non-toxic dose. The 
fraction produced toxicity at all levels tested (50-400 mg/kg) but the extent of 
toxicity was found dose-dependent. At lower doses this fraction induced partial 
growth inhibition over 36 days and higher doses proved fatal within 6 days. It 
was observed that 230 mg/kg caused 50% mortality in rats and this value is 1380 
mg/m2 when expressed for body surface area. This work will be of some use in the 
cancer chemotherapy study of the fraction.

Paste made out of an instant betel nut preparation was painted into the oral 
cavity of 21 albino rats on alternate days for a period of six months. Biopsies 
were taken from the oral mucosa at the beginning of the study and every two 
months there after and compared histopathologically with those obtained from a 
control group of 14 albino rats. Mild to moderate loss of nuclear polarity and 
increase in keratoses, parakeratoses, inflammatory cell infiltration and 
vascularity were noted when compared to the control group. The increase in 
mitotic figures was statistically insignificant and no definite changes in 
pigmentation or atypical cells were seen. These findings suggest the possibility 
of mild leukoplakia. Submucosal collagen increased steeply and steadily 
throughout the study period and at the end of six months, 88.23 per cent of 
biopsies showed thickened and condensed sub-mucosal collagen, indicating 
submucous fibrosis.

Alterations in p53 tumour suppressor gene and its expression may be implicated 
in the pathogenesis of betel- and tobacco-related oral cancer. There is wide 
regional variation in betel- and tobacco-consuming habits in different parts of 
the Indian subcontinent. The purpose of this study was to determine the 
correlations between p53 gene mutations, protein accumulation and serum 
antibodies in oral precancer and cancer. We analysed 30 potentially malignant 
oral lesions (leukoplakia) and 30 oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) from 
northern India because the betel quid-consuming habits are different from those 
prevalent in other regions of India. p53 mutations were analysed by polymerase 
chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and direct sequencing, p53 protein 
accumulation by immunohistochemical analysis and circulating p53 antibodies by 
ELISA. p53 gene mutations, analysed within exons 5-9, were observed in five out 
of 30 (17%) potentially malignant oral lesions and seven out of 30 (23%) oral 
SCCs. All the mutations were base substitution mutations. Three missense and two 
nonsense mutations were observed in potentially malignant oral lesions, while 
six missense and one nonsense mutations were identified in oral SCCs. The 
probable hot spots for the mutations were identified at codons 126, 136 and 174, 
which have not been observed thus far. A good correlation was observed between 
p53 missense mutation, p53 antibodies and p53 protein accumulation in matched 
potentially malignant and malignant oral lesions. All the potentially malignant 
and cancerous lesions harbouring missense mutations showed accumulation of p53 
protein and the majority of these patients showed circulating p53 antibodies 
suggesting that serological detection of p53 antibodies may serve as a surrogate 
marker for p53 alterations in oral lesions.

Augmentation of murine natural killer cell and antibody dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity activities by Phyllanthus emblica, a new immunomodulator.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

When administered orally, Phyllanthus emblica, an excellent source of vitamin C 
(ascorbate), has been found to enhance natural killer (NK) cell activity and 
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in syngeneic BALB/c mice, 
bearing Dalton's lymphoma ascites (DLA) tumor. P. emblica elicited a 2-fold 
increase in splenic NK cell activity on day 3 post tumor inoculation. Enhanced 
activity was highly significant on days 3, 5, 7 and 9 after tumor inoculation 
with respect to the untreated tumor bearing control. A significant enhancement 
in ADCC was documented on days 3, 7, 9, 11 and 13 in drug treated mice as 
compared to the control. An increase in life span (ILS) of 35% was recorded in 
tumor bearing mice treated with P. emblica. This increased survival was 
completely abrogated when NK cell and killer (K) cell activities were depleted 
either by cyclophosphamide or anti-asialo-GM1 antibody treatment. These results 
indicate: (a) an absolute requirement for a functional NK cell or K cell 
population in order that P. emblica can exert its effect on tumor bearing 
animals, and (b) the antitumor activity of P. emblica is mediated primarily 
through the ability of the drug to augment natural cell mediated cytotoxicity.

The nature of the atmospheric particulate matters (PMs) varies depending on 
their sizes and their origin from different activities in the background 
environment. These PMs are associated with potentially hazardous elements (PHEs) 
such as organic compounds (e.g. Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons) that can be harmful 
to health. The main objective of this work is the identification and 
investigation of the toxicological aspects of PHEs in PMs during pre-monsoon and 
post-monsoon season in an urban area of Northeast region (NER) of India. In the 
course of the study, the 24 -hs average concentrations of PMs were detected to 
be more than two-times higher than the Indian standard limit (NAAQ, category) 
which indicates poor air quality in both the seasons around the sampling sites. 
This study demonstrates that the concentrations of PM-bound PAHs are mutagenic 
and that the Excess Cancer Risks exceed the USEPA standard limits. PMs cause 
cytotoxicity and can also induce genotoxicity to human health analyzed by cell 
culture and gel electrophoresis. This study helps to promote research to 
evaluate the PMs bound PHEs toxicity in diverse human cell lines and also their 
relationship with climatic factors as well as quantitative source apportionment 
for mitigation purposes.

An efficient regioselective synthesis of polycyclic diheteroaryl[b,d]pyrans and 
diheteroaryl[c,e][1,2]diazepines has been reported through ring transformation 
reactions of 2-oxo-2,5-dihydrothiochromeno[4,3-b]pyrans (3,4), 
2-oxo-5,6-dihydro-2H-benzo[b]pyrano[2,3-d]oxepine/thiepine (8, 9) and 
6-oxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyrano[2,3-d]oxepine (15) by hydrazine, at 
ambient and reflux temperature. Nine compounds viz 5a,b; 10a,c,d; 12b; 13b; 16 
and 1-methylthio-5,6-dihydrobenzo[f]quinoline (0.1-100 μM) were screened for 
their cytotoxicity in normal (IEC-6), carcinoma (Colo-205) and HepG2 cell lines. 
None of the compounds showed cytotoxicity in normal IEC-6 cells while 10a,d and 
16 resulted in killing of Colo-205 cells with IC50 ranging 20-60 μM while 10c 
and 13b caused killing of HepG2 cells with IC50 values ranging 60-80 μM 
concentration. Further, 10a,d and 16 caused apoptosis through a cascade of 
mitochondrial pathway in Colo-205 cells indicating anticancerous potential 
against intestinal cancer. Interestingly, compounds 10c and 13b exhibited 
apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway in HepG2 cells suggesting anticancer 
activity against hepatic cancer.

The sesquiterpene parthenolide (PRT) is an active component of Mexican-Indian 
medicinal plants and also of the common herb of European origin feverfew. PRT is 
considered to be a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB. Human leukemic HL-60, 
Jurkat, and Jurkat IkappaBalphaM cells, the latter expressing a 
dominant-negative IkappaBalpha and thus having non-functional NF-kappaB, were 
treated with PRT and activation of caspases, plasma membrane integrity, DNA 
fragmentation, chromatin condensation (probed by DNA susceptibility to 
denaturation), and changes in cell morphology were determined. As a positive 
control for apoptosis cells were treated with topotecan (TPT) and H2O2. At 2-8 
microM concentration PRT induced transient cell arrest in G2 and M followed by 
apoptosis. A narrow range of PRT concentration (2-10 microM) spanned its 
cytostatic effect, induction of apoptosis and induction of necrosis. In fact, 
necrotic cells were often seen concurrently with apoptotic cells at the same PRT 
concentration. Atypical apoptosis was characterized by loss of plasma membrane 
integrity very shortly after caspases activation. In contrast, a prolonged phase 
of caspase activation with preserved integrity of plasma membrane was seen 
during apoptosis induced by TPT or H2O2. Necrosis induced by PRT was also 
atypical, characterized by rapid rupture of plasma membrane and no increase in 
DNA susceptibility to denaturation. Using Jurkat cells with inactive NF-kappaB 
we demonstrate that cell cycle arrest and the mode of cell death induced by PRT 
were not caused by inhibition of NF-kappaB. The data suggest that regardless of 
caspase activation PRT targets plasma membrane causing its destruction. A 
caution, therefore, should be exercised in interpreting data of the experiments 
in which PRT is used with the intention to specifically prevent activation of 
NF-kappaB.

Harmful effects of tobacco noticed in history.

Chattopadhayya A.

According to medical investigations tobacco smoking causes cancer of lip, 
tongue, tonsil and other parts of the mouth. And also lung cancer, chronic 
bronchitis, coronary artery diseases and emphysema are caused by cigarette 
smoking. Three contemporary rulers, emperor Jahangir of India, James I of 
England and Shah Abbas I of Persia noticed the harmful effects of tobacco and 
tried to stop this practice. Khalil Pasha issued a prohibitory decree against 
smoking tobacco and he announced that anybody caught smoking would have his lips 
cut and eyes taken out. In 1044 Hijri, Russia also passed certain regulations 
against smoking. In India Guru Govind Singh prohibited tobacco smoking for the 
members of the Sikh community. He said "Wine is bad; Indian hemp (bhang) 
destroyth one generation; but tobacco destroyth all generations'.

Many Indian Ayurvedic (science of life) agents have been introduced into the 
U.S.A. as food supplements. Two of them, Maharishi Amrit Kalash-Ambrosia (MAK-A) 
and Maharishi Amrit Kalash-Nectar (MAK-N) are under investigation. This study 
shows that an ethanol extract of MAK-A induced morphological (neurite formation) 
and biochemical (increase of activity of tyrosine hydroxylase by about 15-fold) 
differentiation in murine neuroblastoma (NBP2) cells in culture, whereas an 
aqueous extract of MAK-A increased only the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase but 
to a much lesser extent. The treatment time of 3 days was needed for the 
expression of maximum differentiation. Ethanol extracts of MAK-A and aqueous 
extracts of MAK-A increased the intracellular level of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic 
monophosphate (cAMP) by about 4-fold in 3 days but they did not do so in 15 min. 
Ethanol extracts of MAK-A also induced neurite formation in neuroblastoma cells 
grown in serum free medium but the concentration requirement was about a fifth 
of that needed in serum. The treatment time of 24 hr was sufficient to induce 
optimal differentiation in neuroblastoma cells grown in serum free medium. The 
differentiating agents in ethanol-MAK-A were resistant to heat and light and 
could not be removed by treatment with activated charcoal. Neither ethanol-MAK-N 
nor aqueous-MAK-N induced differentiation in neuroblastoma cells, suggesting 
that the differentiating agents were present only in MAK-A.

Inhibition of benzopyrene-induced forestomach tumors by field bean protease 
inhibitor(s).

India.

Protease inhibitors (PIs), particularly the soybean-derived Bowman-Birk 
inhibitor, have proved to be powerful blockers of carcinogenesis in many in 
vitro and animal model systems. However, so far an ability of PIs to suppress 
gastric carcinogenesis has not been demonstrated, because of the anticipated 
'hostile' acidic gastric environment for the PI to exert its action. We 
therefore examined the ability of a purified PI from the Indian legume the field 
bean (FBPI), when administered by gavage, to subdue benzopyrene (BP)-induced 
neoplasia of the forestomach of mice. Forestomach tumors were produced in female 
Swiss albino mice by oral administration of BP at a dose of 1 mg twice weekly 
for 4 weeks. Groups of mice were treated per os with an aqueous solution of FBPI 
for 3 months or more at a dose of 20 mg/kg once daily, six times a week, either 
from the initiation of carcinogenesis or after completion of the carcinogen 
treatment. Another group was treated likewise with autoclaved inactive FBPI. 
Mice of both the FBPI-treated groups showed statistically significant (P < 
0.001) reductions in the multiplicity of gastric tumors, with the tumor 
incidence being unaffected. However, the suppression of tumor multiplicity was 
appreciably (P < 0.01) more in the group that received FBPI treatment 
concomitantly with the carcinogen. The mice that were treated with 
heat-inactivated FBPI showed similar tumor multiplicity to the BP-treated group, 
indicating that the oncopreventive activity of FBPI is related to its protease 
inhibitory capacity. These observations point to the potential of PIs as 
effective chemoprotectors against gastric cancer in animals and, possibly, in 
humans as well.

Incidence of oral leucoplakias among 20,358 Indian villagers in a 7-year period.

Mehta FS, Pindborg JJ, Bhonsle RB, Sinor PN.

A group of 20,358 villagers in two districts of India has been followed for 7 
years to study the incidence of oral leucoplakia. The follow-up rate of the 
population in two districts ranged from 61% to 71%. In one of the districts 
(Bhavnagar) no new cases of leucoplakia were found among females in the 7-year 
period. Among males 105 cases developed (4-0/1000/year). The incidence was 
highest among hookli (clay pipe) smokers. In the Ernakulam district the 
incidence among males was 3-3/1000/year whereas among females it was 
1-9/1000/year. The mixed habits group had the highest incidence of oral 
leucoplakias (7-2 and 9-9/1000/year among males and females respectively).

Lupeol, present in fruits and medicinal plants, is a biologically active 
compound that has been shown to have various pharmacological properties in 
experimental studies. In the present study, we demonstrated the modulatory 
effect of lupeol on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced alterations on 
cell proliferation in the skin of Swiss albino mice. Lupeol treatment showed 
significant (p < 0.05) preventive effects with marked inhibition at 48, 72, and 
96 h against DMBA-mediated neoplastic events. Cell-cycle analysis showed that 
lupeol-induced G2/M-phase arrest (16-37%) until 72 h, and these inhibitory 
effects were mediated through inhibition of the cyclin-B-regulated signaling 
pathway involving p53, p21/WAF1, cdc25C, cdc2, and cyclin-B gene expression. 
Further lupeol-induced apoptosis was observed, as shown by an increased sub-G1 
peak (28%) at 96 h, with upregulation of bax and caspase-3 genes and 
downregulation of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 and survivin genes. Thus, our results 
indicate that lupeol has novel anti-proliferative and apoptotic potential that 
may be helpful in designing strategies to fight skin cancer.

Flavonolignans isolated from Hydnocarpus wightiana seeds, namely hydnowightin, 
hydnocarpin, and neohydnocarpin, demonstrated potent hypolipidemic activity in 
mice, lowering both serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels at 8 mg/kg/day ip. 
Hydnowightin demonstrated the best lipid-lowering effect of the three compounds. 
Good anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activity was demonstrated by 
hydnocarpin in mice in vivo. The other two derivatives were not as active in 
these screens. Cytotoxicity against the growth of murine and human tissue 
cultured cells was shown. All three compounds were moderately active against 
murine L-1210 leukemia growth. All three compounds demonstrated good activity 
against the growth of human KB nasopharynx, colon adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, 
and HeLa-S3 uterine growth. Hydnocarpin was the only compound of the three which 
was active against glioma growth. Hydnocarpin and neohydnocarpin demonstrated 
significant activity against Tmolt3 leukemia cell growth.

The effects of betel-nut chewing on the buccal mucosa of 296 Indians and Malays 
in West Malaysia. A clinical study.

Chin CT, Lee KW.

Changes in the buccal mucosa of 296 Indian and Malay betel-nut chewers in Perak, 
West Malaysia, were studied clinically. 167 out of 212 Indian subjects 
incorporated tobacco in their quids, while 45 out of 84 Malay subjects 
incorporated. "Gambir". The Indians appeared to show a higher proportion of 
mucosal changes, particularly when tobacco was used. "Gambir" did not appear to 
be potent in the production of mucosal changes. Comparison with studies in other 
parts of the world suggested comparable findings with respect to both tobacco 
and non-tobacco chewing samples, and there would appear to be some evidence that 
tobacco-containing quids are likely to produce a higher proportion of mucosal 
changes as compared to non-tobacco-containing quids. An attempt to demonstrate a 
dose-effect relationship by dividing the subjects into "slight" and "heavy" 
chewers did not yield significant differences between these two categories in 
each of the groups.

32P-postlabelling analysis of aromatic DNA adducts in human oral mucosal cells.

Dunn BP, Stich HF.

Exfoliated mucosal cells were collected from the oral cavity of three groups at 
high risk for oral cancer: Indian betel nut chewers, Filipino inverted smokers 
(burning end of cigar in mouth) and Indian Khaini tobacco chewers. DNA was 
extracted from these samples, as well as from samples of exfoliated cells of 
Canadian non-smoking controls. DNA was analyzed for the presence of aromatic DNA 
adducts using 32P-postlabelling analysis. Five chromatographically distinct 
adducts were found in samples from both the high risk groups and the nonsmoking 
controls. Individual adducts were detectable in approximately 30-95% of samples, 
depending on the adduct and population group. Estimated levels of specific 
adducts ranged from non-detectable (prevalence relative to normal nucleotides 
less than 1 X 10(-9)) to occasionally greater than 1 X 10(-7). No adducts were 
found in high risk groups which did not also appear in control subjects.

The chemopreventive role of an Indian medicinal plant Mikania cordata 
(Compositae), which is consumed as vegetable and advocated in folk-medicine, has 
been evaluated through its effects on Phase 1 and 2 of the hepatic 
drug-detoxifying enzyme system in rats. Although oral administration of a 
methanolic extract of this plant root (50, 100 or 150 mg/kg for 4, 8 or 12 
weeks) has been found to have very little or no effect on hepatic microsomal 
cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5 contents as well as NADPH cytochrome c 
reductase activity, it afforded a marked induction of uridine 
diphosphoglucuronyl transferase activities of liver microsomes. The extract also 
significantly increased the activities of microsomal uridine diphosphoglucose 
dehydrogenase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate): quinine 
reductase and cytosolic glutathione s-transferases with a concomittant elevation 
in the contents of reduced glutathione. All these effects were found to be 
dose-dependent and maintained during 12 weeks of the extract treatment. Results 
of the study clearly indicate that the intracellular contents of active 
intermediates of various xenobiotics including chemical carcinogens would be 
reduced by the specific enhancement of drug-detoxifying enzymes in the liver of 
rats treated with the plant extract.

The chemopreventive action of garlic extract on DMBA-induced complete skin 
carcinogenesis system was studied in random bred, 6-7 weeks old, male Swiss 
albino mice. Topical weekly application of DMBA for 25 weeks at two dose levels, 
i.e. 200 nmol during the first week followed by 100 nmol during subsequent 
weeks, or 400 nmol during the first week followed by 200 nmol during subsequent 
weeks, resulted in 73.9% and 100% tumor incidences respectively. When garlic 
extract was topically applied twice daily for 3 days every week prior to 
above-stated dose schedules of DMBA, the incidences of tumors were reduced to 
31.8% (P less than 0.01) and 43.4% (P less than 0.01) respectively.

The southwestern Indian paintbrush, Castilleja linariaefolia, yielded extracts 
that displayed in vivo activity against murine P-388 (PS) lymphocytic leukemia. 
Separation guided by PS cell line inhibition led to isolation of cytotoxic 
compounds that were identified as the known glycosides acteoside [1] (ED50 2.6 
micrograms/ml) and isoacteoside [2] (ED50 10 micrograms/ml). The identifications 
were established by spectral measurements and degradation studies. Mannitol was 
also found in this plant.

MDM2/p53 co-expression in oral premalignant and malignant lesions: potential

Nagar, New Delhi, India.

The expression of MDM2 protein in betel and tobacco related oral malignancies in 
Indian population, its relationship to clinicopathological parameters and p53 
protein expression was investigated. Sixty five oral squamous cell carcinomas 
(SCCs), 33 premalignant lesions (leukoplakia) and 30 normal oral tissues were 
assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. MDM2 protein was overexpressed in 
51/65 (78%) oral SCCs and 17/33 (52%) premalignant lesions; 11/23 hyperplastic 
lesions and 6/10 dysplastic lesions. mdm2 gene amplification is an infrequent 
event in oral tumorigenesis. Elevation in the level of MDM2 protein not only in 
oral SCCs but also in premalignant lesions suggests that altered MDM2 expression 
is an early even in the pathogenesis of oral neoplasia. The hallmark of the 
study was the significant association of MDM2 expression with the p53 protein 
accumulation in 16/33 (49%) oral premalignant lesions (p = 0.001) and 39/65 
(60%) malignant lesions (p = 0.021), suggesting an active role for MDM2 in 
binding and inactivating p53 in oral tumorigenesis. Further, significant 
association of MDM2/p53 co-expression was observed with advanced tumour stage (p 
= 0.0009), as well as lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0325) features associated 
with aggressive tumour behaviour and poor prognosis. Discordant 
MDM2+/p53-phenotype was observed in 12/65 (18%) oral SCCs suggesting a 
p53-independent role for MDM2 in the pathogenesis of a subset of oral 
carcinomas. In conclusion, alterations in MDM2 and p53 expression are early 
events likely to be involved in preinvasive stages in oral tumorigenesis and may 
be indicative of a 'gain of function' phenotype with more aggressive 
characteristics.

Effects of topically applied betel leaf extract (BLE) and its constituents. 
beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, eugenol and hydroxychavicol on 
7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced skin tumors were evaluated in two 
strains of mice. BLE, beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol, significantly 
inhibited the tumor formation by 83, 86, 86% in Swiss mice and 92, 94 and 89% in 
male Swiss bare mice respectively. Hydroxychavicol showed 90% inhibition in 
Swiss bare mice at 24 weeks of treatment. Eugenol showed minimal protection in 
both strains of mice. The mean latency period and survivors in BLE, 
beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol and hydroxychavicol treated groups were 
remarkably high as compared to DMBA alone treated group. Intraperitoneal 
injection of betal leaf constituents showed a significant effect on both 
glutathione and glutathione S-transferase levels in the Swiss mouse skin.

Khastgir HN.

The South American Simaba cuspidata Spruce and North Indian Ailanthus grandis 
Prain were investigated as sources of potentially useful antineoplastic agents. 
Both of these Simaroubaceae plant species were found to produce 6 
alpha-tigloyloxychaparrinone (4a) and the new quassinoid 6 
alpha-tigloyloxychaparrin (3b). The latter structure was determined by 
interpretation of spectral data and oxidation to 6 alpha-tigloyloxychaparrinone 
(4a). While both glycol 3b and alpha-ketol 4a were found to significantly 
inhibit growth of the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line, only the 
alpha-ketol (4a) inhibited growth of the corresponding in vivo system.

Pan masala (PM), a dried powdered mixture containing ingredients like areca nut, 
catechu, lime, cardamom and flavouring agents, is consumed abundantly by Indians 
and is also exported to Western countries. Pan masala with tobacco (PM-T) is 
also available on the market. In view of the role of the ingredients of PM in 
the causation of oral diseases, the possible harmful effects of consuming this 
complex mixture were analysed in individuals regularly consuming PM and among 
healthy non-consuming controls without any habit. Three cytogenetic endpoints 
and two tissues were employed to assess possible DNA damage. Sister chromatid 
exchange and chromosome aberrations were estimated in the peripheral blood 
lymphocytes, tissues indirectly exposed to the substance and the frequency of 
micronucleated cells was scored in the tissue directly in contact with PM, i.e. 
the exfoliated buccal mucosa cells. All three cytogenetic endpoints demonstrated 
a statistically significant increase (P less than 0.001) among the PM consumers 
as compared with the non-consuming controls.
