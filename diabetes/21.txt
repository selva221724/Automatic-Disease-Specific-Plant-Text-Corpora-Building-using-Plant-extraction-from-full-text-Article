The global problem of diabetes, together with 
the limited access of large numbers of patients to conventional antidiabetic 
medicines, continues to drive the search for new agents. Ancient Asian systems 
such as traditional Chinese medicine, Japanese Kampo medicine, and Indian 
Ayurvedic medicine, as well as African traditional medicine and many others have 
identified numerous plants reported anecdotally to treat diabetes; there are 
probably more than 800 such plants for which there is scientific evidence for 
their activity, mostly from studies using various models of diabetes in 
experimental animals.
AIM OF THE REVIEW: Rather than a comprehensive coverage of the literature, this 
article aims to identify discrepancies between findings in animal and human 
studies, and to highlight some of the problems in developing plant extract-based 
medicines that lower blood glucose in patients with diabetes, as well as to 
suggest potential ways forward.
METHODS: In addition to searching the 2018 PubMed literature using the terms 
'extract AND blood glucose, a search of the whole literature was conducted using 
the terms 'plant extracts' AND 'blood glucose' AND 'diabetes' AND 'double blind' 
with 'clinical trials' as a filter. A third search using PubMed and Medline was 
undertaken for systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigating the effects of 
plant extracts on blood glucose/glycosylated haemoglobin in patients with 
relevant metabolic pathologies.
FINDINGS: Despite numerous animal studies demonstrating the effects of plant 
extracts on blood glucose, few randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trials have been conducted to confirm efficacy in treating humans with diabetes; 
there have been only a small number of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of 
clinical studies. Qualitative and quantitative discrepancies between animal and 
human clinical studies in some cases were marked; the factors contributing to 
this included variations in the products among different studies, the doses 
used, differences between animal models and the human disease, and the impact of 
concomitant therapy in patients, as well as differences in the duration of 
treatment, and the fact that treatment in animals may begin before or very soon 
after the induction of diabetes.
CONCLUSION: The potential afforded by natural products has not yet been realised 
in the context of treating diabetes mellitus. A systematic, coordinated, 
international effort is required to achieve the goal of providing anti-diabetic 
treatments derived from medicinal plants.
