Using five experimental models, the blood sugar lowering efficacy of eight 
plants of Cucurbitaceae family has been assessed. The ethanolic extract of 
Cucumis sativus Linn, Cucumis melo utilissimum Roxb, Cucumis melo Linn, 
Benincasa hispida Thunb Cogn and Tricosanthes anguina Nees, when administered in 
250 mg/kg dose, orally to rats failed to lower blood sugar or to depress the 
peak value, after glucose load. However, ethanolic extract of Momordica 
charantia Linn plant and Coccinia indica Whit and Arn root significantly lowered 
blood sugar in fasted model and depressed the peak value in glucose loaded 
model. Ethanolic extract of Tricosanthes dioica Roxb plant caused a significant 
lowering of blood sugar in fasted rats and depressed the peak value in glucose 
loaded single and longterm fed groups of rats. The ethanolic extract of the 
aerial part of T. dioica also induced significant depression in the peak values 
in the glucose loaded models.
