CONTEXT: Protein glycation is the major contributing factor in the development 
of diabetic complications. The antiglycation potential of medicinal plants 
provides a promising opportunity as complementary interventions for 
complications.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antiglycation potential of 19 medicinal plants 
extracts using albumin by estimating different indicators: (1) glycation (early 
and late), (2) albumin oxidation, and (3) amyloid aggregation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of aqueous plant extracts (1% w/v) on protein 
glycation was assessed by incubating albumin (10?mg/mL) with fructose (250?mM) 
for 4 days. Degree of protein glycation in the absence and presence of plant 
extracts was assessed by estimating fructosamine, advanced glycation end 
products (AGEs), carbonyls, free thiol group and ß-amyloid aggregation.
RESULTS: Petroselinum crispum, Boerhavia diffusa, Terminalia chebula, Swertia 
chirayita and Glycyrrhiza glabra showed significant antiglycating activity. P. 
crispum and A. barbadensis inhibited the carbonyl stress and protected the thiol 
group from oxidative damage. There was significant correlation between protein 
thiols and amyloid inhibition (R?=?-.69, p?<?.001).
CONCLUSION: P. crispum, B. diffusa and T. chebula had the most potent 
antiglycation activity. These plant exerted noticeable antiglycation activity at 
different glycation modifications of albumin. These findings are important for 
identifying plants with potential to combat diabetic complications.
