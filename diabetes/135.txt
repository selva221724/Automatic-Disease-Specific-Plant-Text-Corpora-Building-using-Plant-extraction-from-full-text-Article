The effect of fenugreek seeds (Trigonella foenum graecum) on blood glucose and 
the serum lipid profile was evaluated in insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetic 
patients. Isocaloric diets with and without fenugreek were each given randomly 
for 10 d. Defatted fenugreek seed powder (100 g), divided into two equal doses, 
was incorporated into the diet and served during lunch and dinner. The fenugreek 
diet significantly reduced fasting blood sugar and improved the glucose 
tolerance test. There was a 54 per cent reduction in 24-h urinary glucose 
excretion. Serum total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides 
were also significantly reduced. The HDL cholesterol fraction, however, remained 
unchanged. These results indicate the usefulness of fenugreek seeds in the 
management of diabetes.
