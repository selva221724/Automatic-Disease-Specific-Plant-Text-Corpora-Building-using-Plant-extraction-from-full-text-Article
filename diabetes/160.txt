S-allyl cysteine sulphoxide (SACS), a sulphur containing amino acid of garlic 
which is the precursor of allicin and garlic oil, has been found to show 
significant antidiabetic effects in alloxan diabetic rats. Administration of it 
at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight decreased significantly the concentration of 
serum lipids, blood glucose and activities of serum enzymes like alkaline 
phosphatase, acid phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase and liver 
glucose-6-phosphatase. It increased significantly liver and intestinal HMG CoA 
reductase activity and liver hexokinase activity.
