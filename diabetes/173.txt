1. Effect of epinephrine on the increment index calculated from intravenous 
glucose tolerance tests and on hepatic glycogen before and after A. indica leaf 
extract treatment was studied in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic 
rabbits. 2. A. indica leaf extract, in itself, was found to have no action on 
peripheral utilization of glucose or on hepatic glycogen. 3. The reduction in 
peripheral utilization of glucose and glycogenolytic effect due to epinephrine 
action was blocked by A. indica leaf extract, however, almost completely in 
diabetic rabbits and to a certain extent in normal ones. 4. The results are 
discussed.
