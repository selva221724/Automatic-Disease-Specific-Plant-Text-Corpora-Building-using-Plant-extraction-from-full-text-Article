A multitude of investigations have demonstrated the beneficial hypoglycemic 
effect of millets, fenugreek seeds and legumes in diabetic subjects. However, 
the bitter taste of fenugreek seeds and coarse nature of millets have been 
limitations in using them in daily dietaries. Moreover, as of today, the 
availability of special foods for diabetics in the Indian market is negligible. 
The millets, fenugreek seeds and legumes in judicious combination, after 
suitable processing, were used to formulate three nutritious food 
products--dhokla (leavened steamed cake), uppuma (kedgeree) and laddu (sweet 
balls), which are popular traditional snack foods in India. Evaluation of these 
food products for glycemic response in five normal and five diabetic subjects 
showed hypoglycemic effects in terms of glycemic-index (GI). The highest GI was 
observed for dhokla (34.96) followed by laddu (23.52) and uppuma (17.60) in 
normal subjects. All three food products differed significantly from each other 
in GI. Comparison of GI of all three food products in normal subjects with 
diabetes did not show significant differences (P approximately 0.05). The food 
products were well tolerated and acceptable to the subjects. These food products 
may have an important role in dietary management for diabetic people and may 
cater for their needs on a large scale if commercialized.
