The divine tree neem (Azadirachta indica) is mainly cultivated in the Indian 
subcontinent. Neem has been used extensively by humankind to treat various 
ailments before the availability of written records which recorded the beginning 
of history. The world health organization estimates that 80% of the population 
living in the developing countries relies exclusively on traditional medicine 
for their primary health care. More than half of the world's population still 
relies entirely on plants for medicines, and plants supply the active 
ingredients of most traditional medical products. The review shows the neem has 
been used by humankind to treat various ailments from prehistory to 
contemporary.
