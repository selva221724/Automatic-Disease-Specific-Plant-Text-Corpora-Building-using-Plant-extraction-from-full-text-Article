The activity of glyoxalase I from the soluble fraction of diabetic rat liver was 
found to decrease as compared to the control. Sodium orthovanadate in drinking 
water and Trigonella foenum graecum seed powder when administered to these 
diabetic animals were found to reverse the activity of glyoxalase I to control 
values. A combination of the above two antidiabetic compounds showed a better 
reversal. Vanadate and Trigonella seed powder treatment separately to diabetic 
rats also normalized hyperglycemia together with glyoxalase I activity. A 
combination of vanadate and Trigonella seed powder also restored the other 
general parameters of the diabetic animals.
