Since ancient times, plants have been an exemplary source of medicine. Ayurveda 
and other Indian literature mention the use of plants in treatment of various 
human ailments. India has about 45000 plant species and among them, several 
thousands have been claimed to possess medicinal properties. Research conducted 
in last few decades on plants mentioned in ancient literature or used 
traditionally for diabetes have shown anti-diabetic property. The present paper 
reviews 45 such plants and their products (active, natural principles and crude 
extracts) that have been mentioned/used in the Indian traditional system of 
medicine and have shown experimental or clinical anti-diabetic activity. Indian 
plants which are most effective and the most commonly studied in relation to 
diabetes and their complications are: Allium cepa, Allium sativum, Aloe vera, 
Cajanus cajan, Coccinia indica, Caesalpinia bonducella, Ficus bengalenesis, 
Gymnema sylvestre, Momordica charantia, Ocimum sanctum, Pterocarpus marsupium, 
Swertia chirayita, Syzigium cumini, Tinospora cordifolia and Trigonella foenum 
graecum. Among these we have evaluated M. charantia, Eugenia jambolana, Mucuna 
pruriens, T. cordifolia, T. foenum graecum, O. sanctum, P. marsupium, Murraya 
koeingii and Brassica juncea. All plants have shown varying degree of 
hypoglycemic and anti-hyperglycemic activity.
