Oral administration of alcoholic extract of leaves of O. sanctum led to marked 
lowering of blood sugar level in normal, glucose fed hyperglycemic and 
streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Further the extract potentiated the action 
of exogenous insulin in normal rats. The activity of the extract was 91.55 and 
70.43% of that of tolbutamide in normal and diabetic rats respectively.
