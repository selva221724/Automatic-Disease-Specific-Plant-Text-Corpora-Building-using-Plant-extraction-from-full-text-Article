BACKGROUND: India is currently facing the silent epidemic of ischemic heart 
disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and stroke. Both 
diabetes and ischemic heart disease appear in Indian people a decade earlier 
compared to whites. The recent evidence that certain medicinal plants possess 
hypoglycemic, lipid-lowering, and immunomodulating properties on account of 
their rich flavonoid and/or other glucose-lowering active constituents merits 
scientific scrutiny in this regard.
OBJECTIVES: The present communication aims to give a brief review of those 
plants that could be useful in T2DM associated with hypertension, ischemic heart 
disease, and/or dyslipidemia.
METHODS: Aegle marmelos (bael), Allium sativum (garlic), Curcuma domestica 
(turmeric), Eugenia jambolana (jamun), Murraya koenigii (curry leaves), 
Trigonella foenum graecum (fenugreek), and Terminalia arjuna (arjun) have been 
found to be useful in diabetes associated with ischemic heart disease. Their 
active biomolecules have been identified. They have also been demonstrated to be 
safe in long-term use.
CONCLUSIONS: Further clinical research regarding their potency and efficacy 
vis-à-vis oral hypoglycemics needs to done.
