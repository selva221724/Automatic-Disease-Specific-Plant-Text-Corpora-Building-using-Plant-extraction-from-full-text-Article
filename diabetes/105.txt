Tinospora cordifolia is widely used in Indian Ayurvedic medicine for the 
treatment of diabetes mellitus. Oral administration of 2.5 g and 5.0 g/kg body 
weight of the aqueous extract of the roots for 6 weeks resulted in a significant 
reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and an increase in 
reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in 
alloxan diabetic rats. The effect of Tinospora cordifolia root extract (TCREt) 
was most prominently seen in the case of rats given 5.0 g/kg body weight. The 
effect of TCREt was more effective than glibenclamide. Thus our study shows that 
TCREt exhibits antioxidant action in alloxan diabetes.
