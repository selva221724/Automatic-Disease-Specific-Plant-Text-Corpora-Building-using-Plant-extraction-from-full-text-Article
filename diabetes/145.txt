The petroleum ether extract of the root bark of S. oblonga Wall. (Celastraceae) 
(SOB) was studied in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats and anti-lipid 
peroxidative activity of the same was studied in the cardiac tissue. SOB 
prevented significantly the streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemia and 
hypoinsulinaemia. It also produced a significant decrease in peroxidation 
products viz. thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (P < 0.001), conjugated 
dienes (P < 0.05), hydroperoxides (P < 0.001). The activity of antioxidant 
enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (P < 0.001), catalase (P < 0.001), GSHPxase 
and GSSGRase was found to be increased in the heart tissue of diabetic animals 
treated with SOB. These results suggest that S. oblonga root bark extract 
possesses anti-diabetic and anti-oxidative activity in streptozotocin-diabetic 
rats.
