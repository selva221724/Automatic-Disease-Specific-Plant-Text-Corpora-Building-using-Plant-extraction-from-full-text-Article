Hypoglycemic, diuretic and hypocholesterolemic effects of roots of W. somnifera 
(ashvagandha) were assessed on human subjects. Six mild NIDDM subjects and six 
mild hypercholesterolemic subjects were treated with the powder of roots of W. 
somnifera for 30 days. Suitable parameters were studied in the blood and urine 
samples of the subjects along with dietary pattern before and at the end of 
treatment period. Decrease in blood glucose was comparable to that of an oral 
hypoglycemic drug. Significant increase in urine sodium, urine volume, 
significant decrease in serum cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL (low density 
lipoproteins) and VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) cholesterol were observed 
indicating that root of W. somnifera is a potential source of hypoglycemic, 
diuretic and hypocholesterolemic agents. Clinical observations revealed no 
adverse effects.
