Salacia oblonga Wall. is an endangered medicinal plant whose conservation is 
urgently needed, as it is extensively used in the Indian Ayurvedic system of 
medicine to treat diabetes mellitus. This study shows an easy, effective and 
simple method of conserving genetic identity and producing elite clones of S. 
oblonga through vegetative propagation. Vegetative propagation was achieved 
using roots (R), stems with leaves (SL) and stems without leaves (S) with 
different concentrations (0-500 ppm) of indole butyric acid (IBA). Explants S 
and SL showed maximum shooting response with 300 ppm IBA and explant R showed 
maximum response with 200 ppm IBA.
