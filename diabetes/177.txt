The effects of insulin, sodium orthovanadate and a hypoglycemic plant material, 
Trigonella foenum graecum (fenugreek) seed powder were studied on the activities 
of glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in diabetic liver and 
kidney. The significantly increased activities of the two enzymes during 
diabetes in liver and kidney were found to be lowered to almost control values 
by the use of the antidiabetic compounds. Diabetic liver exhibited a much 
greater increase in the activities of the two enzymes than diabetic kidney. The 
highest percentage of reversal to normal values was seen using the combination 
of vanadate and Trigonella seed powder. The lowered rate of growth of the 
animals as well as the increased blood sugar were reversed almost to the control 
levels by the Trigonella seed powder and vanadate treatment. The inclusion of 
the Trigonella seed powder overcame the toxicity of vanadium encountered when it 
was given alone as insulin mimetic agent. Much lower levels of vanadate were 
needed when it was given in combination with Trigonella seed powder. Their 
combined effects were better at restoring the above parameters than those 
induced by insulin administration.
