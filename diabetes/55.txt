Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder caused by insufficient or 
inefficient insulin secretary response and it is characterized by increased 
blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). DM is a heterogonous group of syndromes. 
Glucose is the main energy source for the body, and in the case of DM, 
management of glucose becomes irregular. There are three key defects in the 
onset of hyperglycemia in DM, namely increased hepatic glucose production, 
diminished insulin secretion, and impaired insulin action. Conventional drugs 
treat diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity, increasing insulin production 
and/or decreasing the amount of glucose in blood. This article provides a 
comprehensive review of the mode of action of most popular hypoglycemic herbs, 
such as ginseng, bitter melon, fenugreek, banaba, Gymnema sylvestre and Coptis 
chinensis. The herbs act by increasing insulin secretion, enhancing glucose 
uptake by adipose and skeletal muscle tissues, inhibiting intestinal glucose 
absorption and inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Although evidence from 
animals and humans consistently supports the therapeutic effect of these 
phytomedicines, multicenter large-scale clinical trials have not been conducted 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these herbal medicines and their 
interaction with conventional drugs when administered simultaneously.
