Although a number of chemicals have been isolated from Lantana camara, only a 
few have been evaluated for their biological significance. As part of our drug 
discovery program for cytotoxic agents from Indian medicinal plants, roots of L. 
camara L. were chemically investigated, which resulted in the isolation and 
identification of a cytotoxic agent, oleanolic acid (1b) as a major constituent. 
Oleanolic acid was converted into six semi-synthetic ester (2-7) and seven amide 
(8-14) derivatives. The ester derivatives (2-7) showed 3-6 times more selective 
activity than 1b against the human ovarian cancer cell line (IGR-OV-1), while 
amide derivatives 8-14 showed 16-53 times more selective activity against the 
human lung cancer cell line (HOP-62). Structure activity relationship within the 
ester (2-7) and amide (8-14) derivatives are discussed.
