During an epidemiologic study of oral cancer and precancerous lesions among 
Indian villagers, a lichen planus-like lesion was observed in Kerala. The lesion 
consisted of white, wavy, parallel, non-elevated lines that could not be scraped 
off. The lesion occurred exclusively among chewers and at the site of placement 
of quid. There were no subjective symptoms. The peak prevalence of the 35 
diagnosed lesions was in the 35-44 years age-group for males and 45-54 for 
females. There was a marked female predominance. The histologic features were 
very similar to those seen in oral lichen planus.
