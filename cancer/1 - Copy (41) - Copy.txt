As part of pharmacological-phytochemical integrated studies on medicinal plants 
from Indian flora, costunolide (1) and dehydrocostus lactone (2), were isolated 
as major phytochemicals from Saussurea lappa, a plant traditionally used in 
different Asian systems of medicine. A series of 
1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazoles conjugates were synthesized through diastereo 
selective Michael addition followed by regioselective Huisgen 1,3-dipolar 
cycloaddition reactions. All these triazolyl derivatives (5a-5j) & (7a-7j) were 
well characterized using modern spectroscopic techniques and evaluated for their 
anticancer activity against a panel of five human cancerous celllines. The 
results indicated that all the analogs displayed moderate cytotoxic activity.
