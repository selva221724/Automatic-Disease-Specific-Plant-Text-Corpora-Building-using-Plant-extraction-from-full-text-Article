Oral submucous fibrosis is a potent pre-cancerous condition which occurs almost 
exclusively in Indians but cases have been reported from several countries. The 
definite aetiology of OSMF is still unknown and there is no known treatment for 
it. Chilles, tobacco use, vitamin deficiencies and betel quid chewing have been 
implicated. Ramanathan is of the view that OSMF seems to be the Asian version of 
sideropenic dysphagia. He suggests that OSMF appears to be an altered oral 
mucosa following prolonged period of chronic deficiency of iron and/or vitamin 
"B" complex especially folic acid. This changed state of the oral mucosa 
subsequently appears to develop more easily a hypersensitivity to oral irritants 
such as spices especially chillies and to the betel quid. We hold that the 
hypersensitivity caused by local irritants and the resultant persistent juxta 
epithelial inflammatory response noted in OSMF (in a host system already primed 
by an intrinsic genetic defect) act as the initiating factor leading to a 
defective inflammatory--reparative response, culminating in fibrotic healing. 
The role of iron and "B"complex together with others may be contributory 
(promotor) to this pre-existing pathologic response of the lamina propria.
