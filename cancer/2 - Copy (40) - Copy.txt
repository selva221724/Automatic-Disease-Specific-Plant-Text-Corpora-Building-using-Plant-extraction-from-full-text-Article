DMBA (195 nmol/50 microliters of acetone/animal) was applied topically over the 
dorsal skin of the mice and tumors were promoted by repeated applications of 
croton oil (1% in acetone, three times per week) after two weeks of DMBA 
application. Skin papillomas appeared in 100% animals in control as well as in 
groups treated orally with Liv. 52 at post-initiational stages and continuously 
at peri-initiational and post-initiational stages of papillomagenesis. When Liv. 
52 was given orally at the peri-initiational stage of papillomagenesis, the 
percentage of mice bearing tumors was 75% and the tumor mean per mouse was 
reduced to 4.0 +/- 1.63 as compared to 7.5 +/- 3.54 in the control group after 
15 weeks of observation. The tumor mean per mouse was observed to be 4.75 +/- 
0.55 and 2.5 +/- 0.57 in the groups treated orally with Liv. 52 at the 
post-initiational stages and continuously at peri-initiational and 
post-initiational stages of papillomagenesis respectively. Similarly, the 
cumulative number of papillomas after 15 weeks was 30 in the control group, 
which was reduced to 10 in the animals treated with Liv. 52 continuously at 
peri-initiational and post-initiational stages. The cumulative number of 
papillomas was also reduced to 16 and 19 in animals treated with Liv. 52 at 
peri-initiational and post-initiational stages, respectively.
