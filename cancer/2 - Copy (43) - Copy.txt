Petroleum ether extract from H. spinosa root exhibited antitumor activity in 
Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and Sarcoma-180 bearing mice Processed extract 
suppressed significantly the tumor fluid volume at the end of 3 weeks 
experiment. It decreased about 50% of packed cell volume and increased life span 
of EAC/S-180 bearing mice in a day dependent manner. Red blood cell count, 
hemoglobin content and white blood cell count were more or less normal after 
processed extract treatment of the tumor bearing mice. In tumor control animals, 
neutrophils increased (273.7% in EAC and 263.4% in S-180 bearing mice 
respectively with respect to normal mice) whereas lymphocytes decreased (60.0% 
in EAC and 56.5% in S-180 bearing mice respectively with respect to normal 
mice). It also inhibited the rapid increase of body weight of tumor bearing 
mice.
