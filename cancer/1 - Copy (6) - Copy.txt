Indian soil germinates thousands of medicinal drugs that are cultivated with a 
purpose to obtain a novel drug. As it is a well-established fact that the 
structural analogs with greater pharmacological activity and fewer side-effects 
may be generated by the molecular modification of the functional groups of such 
lead compounds. This review throws light on two natural triterpenes - Taraxerol 
and Taraxasterol which have many important pharmacological actions including 
anti-cancer activity, their chemistry, biosynthesis aspects, and possible use of 
these compounds as drugs in treatment of cancer. A silent crisis persists in 
cancer treatment in developing countries, and it is intensifying every year. 
Although at least 50-60% of cancer victims can benefit from radiotherapy that 
destroys cancerous tumors, but search for the paramount therapy which will prove 
to be inexpensive with minimal side effects still persists. Various treatment 
modalities have been prescribed, along with conventional and non-conventional 
medicine but due to their adverse effects and dissatisfaction among users, these 
treatments are not satisfactory enough to give relief to patients. Hence, this 
review sparks the occurrence of Taraxerol (VI) and Taraxasterol (VII) in nature, 
so that the natural godowns may be harvested to obtain these potent compounds 
for novel drug development as well as discusses limitations of these lead 
compounds progressing clinical trials.
