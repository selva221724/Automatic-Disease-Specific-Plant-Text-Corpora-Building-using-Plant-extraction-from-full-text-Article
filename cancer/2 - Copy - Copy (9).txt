Chemoprevention is a novel approach to study the anti-initiating and 
anti-tumor-promoting efficacy of medicinal plants and their active principles. 
The present study investigated the chemopreventive potential of Aegle marmelos 
fruit extract in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced skin carcinogenesis and 
its influence on oxidative stress and the antioxidant defense system. The oral 
administration of A marmelos at 100 mg/kg body weight/day during 
peri-initiational, postinitiational, and peri- & postinitiational phases of 
papillomagenesis showed significant reduction in tumor incidence, tumor yield, 
tumor burden, and cumulative number of papillomas when compared with 
carcinogen-treated control. The average latent period significantly increased 
(7.88 weeks; control group) to 9.45, 11.11, and 11.54 weeks in different A 
marmelos extract (AME) experimental groups. Enzyme analysis of skin and liver 
showed a significant elevation in antioxidant parameters such as superoxide 
dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and vitamin C in AME-treated groups when 
compared with the carcinogen-treated control. The elevated level of lipid 
peroxidation in the positive control was significantly inhibited by AME 
administration. These results indicate that AME has the potential to reduce 
chemical-induced skin papillomas by enhancing the antioxidant defense system.
