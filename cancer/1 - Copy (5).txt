Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. The main modality to 
fight against cancer is surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and more 
recently targeted therapy, gene therapy and immunotherapy, which play important 
roles in treating cancer patients. In the last decades, chemotherapy has been 
well developed. Nonetheless, administration of the drug is not always 
successful, as limited drug dosage can reach the tumor cells.. In this context, 
the possibility to use an encapsulated anti-cancer drug may potentially solve 
the problem. Liposomal cytarabine is a formulation with pronounced effectiveness 
in lymphomatous meningitis and reduced cardiotoxicity if compared to liposomal 
anthracyclines. Thus, the future liposomal cytarabine use could be extended to 
other diseases given its reduction in cytotoxic side effects compared to the 
free formulation. This review summarizes the chemistry and biology of liposomal 
cytarabine, with exploration of its clinical implications.
