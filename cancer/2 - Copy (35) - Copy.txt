Beta-carboline-benzoquinolizidine plant alkaloid deoxytubulosine (DTB) was 
evaluated and assessed for the first time for its biochemical and biological 
activity employing the biomarker dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 
(5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate: NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) as the probe 
enzyme, a key target in cancer chemotherapy. DHFR, employed in the present 
investigations was purified from Lactobacillus leichmannii. DTB, isolated from 
the Indian medicinal plant Alangium lamarckii was demonstrated to exhibit potent 
cytotoxicity. The alkaloid potently inhibited the cell growth of L. leichmannii 
and the cellular enzyme activity of DHFR (IC50=40 and 30 microM for the cell 
growth and enzyme inhibitions, respectively). DTB concentrations >75 microM 
resulted in a total loss of the DHFR activity, thus suggesting that the 
beta-carboline-benzoquinolizidine plant alkaloid is a promising potential 
antitumor agent. Our results are also suggestive of its potential antimicrobial 
activity. DTB binding to DHFR appears to be slow and reversible. Inhibition 
kinetics revealed that DHFR has a Ki value of 5x10(-6) M for DTB and that the 
enzyme inhibition is a simple linear 'non-competitive' type.
