The chemopreventive efficacy of the Indian medicinal plant Trianthema 
portulacastrum L. Aizoaceae was tested in a chemical rat hepatocarcinogenesis 
model in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hepatocarcinogenesis was induced by the 
potent carcinogen diethylnitrosoamine (DENA). Treatment of the rats to the basal 
medium with aqueous, ethanolic and chloroform fractions of the plant extract at 
a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight once daily reduced the incidence, numerical 
preponderance, multiplicity and size distribution of visible neoplastic nodules. 
Morphometric evaluation of focal lesions showed a reduction of altered liver 
cell foci/cm2 and a reduction of the average focal area. A decrease in the 
percentage of liver parenchyma occupied by foci seems to suggest the 
anticarcinogenic potential of the plant extract in DENA-induced 
hepatocarcinogenesis.
