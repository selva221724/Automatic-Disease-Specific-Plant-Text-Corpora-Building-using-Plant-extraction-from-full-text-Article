A retrospective study (1983-1989) of oral squamous carcinomas and concomitant 
oral habits was undertaken in South African Indians from Natal. Information came 
from hospital records and interviews with patients, families and friends. There 
were 143 oral squamous carcinomas; these occurred in a ratio of 1:1,6 for men 
and women respectively. Squamous carcinomas of the cheek (buccal mucosa, 
alveolar sulcus and gingiva) occurred most frequently, especially in women 
(57/89--64%), while in men tongue cancer predominated (22/54--41%). Ninety-three 
per cent of women (83/87) and 17% of men (9/54) habitually chewed the areca nut. 
Thirty-nine of 57 women (68%) with cheek cancer and 21/25 (84%) with tongue 
cancer only chewed the nut (no tobacco, snuff or smoking). Analyses confirmed an 
association between nut chewing and cheek cancer. The odds ratio (OR) for oral 
cancer in women 25 years and older who only chewed the nut was 43,9 and the 
attributable risk (AR) 0,89 (89%). With tobacco the OR increases to 47,42 and 
the AR to 0,91 (91%). The data showed that the areca nut habit with or without 
tobacco use is important in the development of oral squamous carcinoma. 
Elimination of this habit can reduce the risk in these women substantially 
(89-91%) if all other factors remain the same.
