ING1, a recently identified candidate tumor suppressor gene, involved in the p53 
signaling pathway is mapped at chromosome 13q34. Since loss of heterozygosity at 
13q34 has been reported in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, we screened 
for mutations in ING1 by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation 
polymorphism in 71 oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) from India, 15 of which 
were known to harbor p53 mutations. A single polymorphism (G to A) was detected 
in 14 (19.7%) of the tumors analyzed. No mutation was observed in any of the 71 
OSCCs analyzed. These results suggest that ING1 is not a target for mutational 
inactivation in OSCC of Indians.
