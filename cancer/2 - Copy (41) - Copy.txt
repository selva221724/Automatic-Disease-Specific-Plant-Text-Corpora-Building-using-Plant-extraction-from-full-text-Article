Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been found to be the single most 
frequent event in human cancers. In India and other southeast Asian countries 
tobacco chewing with betel quid was attributed to be the major factor in oral 
carcinogenesis. We have analyzed 72 untreated primary oral squamous cell 
carcinomas (SCCs) for mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 exons 4-9 by 
PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing. Sequencing analysis revealed 16 missense mutations, 
one silent mutation in codon 307 and four A to G substitution polymorphism in 
codon 213. The incidence of p53 mutation was 21% (15 of 72) excluding the 
polymorphism and the silent mutation. Eight mutations were clustered in codons 
266-282 of exon 8. Of the total mutation events 37.5% were G to A transitions 
and 31.3% were G to T transversions. These results indicate the possible 
involvement of tobacco derived nitrosamines and their adducts in the genesis of 
oral cancer among Indians.
