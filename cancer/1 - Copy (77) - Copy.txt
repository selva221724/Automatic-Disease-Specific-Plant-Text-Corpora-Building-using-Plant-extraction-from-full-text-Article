3-(3',4',5'-Trimethoxyphenyl)-4,5,6-trimethoxy,2-(3?,4?-methylenedioxybenzylidene)-indan-1-one 
(1) is an optimized anti-cancer lead molecule obtained on modification of gallic 
acid, a plant phenolic acid. It exhibited potent cytotoxicities 
(IC50=0.010-14.76µM) against various human carcinoma cells. In cell cycle 
analysis, benzylidene indanone 1 induced G2/M phase arrest in both MCF-7 and 
MDA-MB-231 cells. It also induced apoptosis in DU145 cells which was evident by 
cleavage of PARP. In Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, benzylidene indanone 1 showed 
45.48% inhibition of tumour growth at 20mg/kg dose in Swiss albino mice. 
Further, in sub-acute toxicity experiment in Swiss-albino mice, it was found to 
be non-toxic up to 100mg/kg dose for 28days. The lead compound benzylidene 
indanone 1 can further be optimized for better anti-cancer activity.
