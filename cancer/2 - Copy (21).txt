The antineoplastic effect of Trigonella foenum graecum seed extract has been 
evaluated in the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) model in Balb-C mice. 
Intra-peritoneal administration of the alcohol extract of the seed both before 
and after inoculation of EAC cell in mice produced more than 70% inhibition of 
tumour cell growth with respect to the control. Treatment with the extract was 
found to enhance both the peritoneal exudate cell and macrophage cell counts. 
The extract also produced a significant antiinflammatory effect. We report here 
the antiinflammatory and antineoplastic effects, of Trigonella foenum graecum 
seed extract.
