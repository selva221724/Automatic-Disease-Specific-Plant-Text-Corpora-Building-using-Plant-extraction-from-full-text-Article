Alexander cell line, an human hepatocellular carcinoma derived cell line which 
has the property of secreting HBsAg in the supernatant was used to study the 
antiviral property of phyllanthus amarus. Aquous extract of Phyllanthus amarus 
was evaluated for its in vitro ability to inhibit HBsAg secretion on a dose 
dependent manner. It was seen that P. amarus at 1mg/ml concentration on a single 
dose inhibited the secretion of HBsAg for a period of 48 hours. This experiment 
proved the anti hepatitis B virus property of P. amarus at cellular level and 
further confirmed its beneficial use in the treatment of acute and chronic 
hepatitis B and healthy carriers of HBV.
