India is a home for a large variety of plants with remarkable medicinal and 
pharmacological value. Traditional medicine in the form of Ayurveda, Siddha and 
Unani has used many of these plants since ancient days for treating and curing 
various ailments of the body. When it comes to issues related to reproductive 
health, people still hesitate to discuss and/or accept it openly and hence look 
for alternate and natural remedies. The various tribal populations distributed 
across different parts of the country still use these plant extracts in various 
formulations for maintenance of good health. The medical utilities of several of 
these plants have been documented; however, there are many more, whose potential 
is yet to be explored. This review discusses the role of various plants grown in 
the Indian subcontinent that have been widely used in maintaining various 
aspects of reproductive health in men such as infertility, aphrodisiac, 
contraception, libido, sexually transmitted infections and reproductive tract 
cancers as well as in treating chronic disorders.
