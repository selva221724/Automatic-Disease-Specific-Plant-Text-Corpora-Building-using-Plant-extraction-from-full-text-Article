Although a number of chemicals have been isolated from Terminalia arjuna, only a 
few have been evaluated for their biological significance. As a part of our drug 
discovery programme for cytotoxic agents from Indian medicinal plants, four 
novel cytotoxic agents arjunic acid (1), arjungenin (2), arjunetin (3) and 
arjunoglucoside I (4) were isolated from the bark of T. ARJUNA. Out of the four 
compounds, arjunic acid (1) was significantly active against the human oral 
(KB), ovarian (PA 1) and liver (HepG-2 & WRL-68) cancer cell lines. Further, the 
most active compound arjunic acid was converted into seven semi-synthetic ester 
derivatives 5 - 11. 2-O-Palmitoyl arjunic acid (6) showed two times more 
activity, while 2, 3-di-O-acetyl-, 2-O-p-anisoyl-, 2, 3-di-O-benzoyl- and 2, 
3-di-O-p-nitrobenzoyl arjunic acid (7 - 10) showed 1.7 - 2.3 times less activity 
than the cytotoxic drug vinblastine against the liver cancer cell lines HepG-2 
and WRL-68 respectively.
