Toxicological study was carried out in rats with chloroform-soluble fraction of 
the nuts of Semecarpus anacardium to determine its safe non-toxic dose. The 
fraction produced toxicity at all levels tested (50-400 mg/kg) but the extent of 
toxicity was found dose-dependent. At lower doses this fraction induced partial 
growth inhibition over 36 days and higher doses proved fatal within 6 days. It 
was observed that 230 mg/kg caused 50% mortality in rats and this value is 1380 
mg/m2 when expressed for body surface area. This work will be of some use in the 
cancer chemotherapy study of the fraction.
