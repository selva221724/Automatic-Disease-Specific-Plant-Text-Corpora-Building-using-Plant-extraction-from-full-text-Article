The effect of aqueous extract of Withania somnifera (L. Solanaceae) was studied 
against paclitaxel induced neutropenia in mice. After paclitaxel 1 mg/kg, i.v. 
administration significant fall in total WBC and absolute neutrophil count was 
observed on day 3 and day 5. W. Somnifera (200 mg/kg, p.o.) per se produced 
significant increase in neutrophil counts. W. somnifera (200 mg/kg, p.o.) when 
administered for 4 days before paclitaxel treatment and continued for 12 days 
caused significant reversal of neutropenia of paclitaxel. The findings of the 
study suggest the potential of W. somnifera as an adjuvant during cancer 
chemotherapy for the prevention of bone marrow depression associated with 
anticancer drugs.
