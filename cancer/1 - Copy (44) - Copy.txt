ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Plants have been used in folk medicine by Mayan 
ancient people from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, to treat some diseases 
considered as cancer diseases such as chronic wounds or tumors.
AIM OF THE STUDY: We collected a selection of nine plants in order to 
investigate their cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic extracts were tested for their cytotoxicity 
using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) 
assay on four cancer cell lines; nasopharynx carcinoma (KB), laryngeal carcinoma 
(Hep-2), cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa), and cervix squamous carcinoma cells 
(SiHa) and one normal cell line; canine kidney (MDCK).
RESULTS: All species exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity. The root bark 
extract of Hamelia patens exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity on HeLa cells 
with a CC50 of 13 microg/mL and selectivity index of 13.3, higher than 
docetaxel. Gossypium schottii and Dioon spinulosum showed similar good cytotoxic 
activity and selectivity index on HeLa and Hep-2 cells, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Hamelia patens, Dioon spinulosum and Gossypium schottii 
demonstrated promising cytotoxic activity and have been selected for future 
bio-guided fractionation and isolation of active cytotoxic compounds.
