Natural products are important sources of anti-cancer lead molecules. Many 
successful anti-cancer drugs are natural products or their analogues. Many more 
are under clinical trials. The present review focuses on chemopreventive and 
anti-cancer activities of polar and non-polar extracts, semi purified fractions 
and pure molecules from terrestrial plants of India reported between 2005 and 
2010 emphasizing possible mechanisms of action of pure molecules.
