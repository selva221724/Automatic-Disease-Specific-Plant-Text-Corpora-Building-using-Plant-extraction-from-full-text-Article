A significant antitumour effect of P. hexandrum, a herb thriving at Himalayas 
(2500-4000 m), was observed in strain 'A' mice carrying solid tumours developed 
by transplanting Ehrlich ascites tumour (EAT). Subtoxic well tolerated 
sequential doses of aqueous extract of P. hexandrum (a daily dose of 34.5 mg/kg 
b.w. for 15 days) enhanced tumour doubling time (TDT) from 1.94 +/- 0.26 days to 
19.1 +/- 2.5 days. However, no synergism was revealed between radiation and P. 
hexandrum, though both independently manifested antitumour effects. In normal 
mice, pre-irradiation administration of extract of P. hexandrum protected mice 
in a dose dependent manner (optimal dose being 34.5 mg/kg body.wt. rendering 72% 
survival for 30 days) against whole body lethal irradiation of 10 Gy. 
Radioprotective properties of P. hexandrum were found to be comparable to 
synthetic radioprotectors like diltiazem etc.
