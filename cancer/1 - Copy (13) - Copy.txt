Herbal medicine which involves the use of plants for their medicinal value, 
dates as far back as the origin of mankind and demonstrates an array of 
applications including cardiovascular protection and anti-cancer activities, via 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and metabolic activities. Even today the 
popularity of medicinal herbs is still growing like in traditional medicines 
such as the Indian medicine, Ayurveda. One of the Ayurvedic medicinal plants is 
Withania somnifera Dunal, of which the important constituents are the 
withanolides. Among them, Withaferin A is one of the most bioactive compounds, 
exerting anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic but also anti-invasive and 
anti-angiogenic effects. In the context of modern pharmacology, a better insight 
in the underlying mechanism of the broad range of bioactivities exerted by 
Withaferin A is compulsory. Therefore, a lot of effort was made to explore the 
intracellular effects of Withaferin A and to characterize its target proteins. 
This review provides a decisive insight on the molecular basis of the 
health-promoting potential of Withaferin A.
