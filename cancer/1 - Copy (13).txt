Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths throughout the world. 
Extracts of medicinal plants are believed to contain different chemopreventive 
or chemotherapeutic compounds. In this study, we determined the anti-cancer 
property of one of the traditional Indian medicine Rasagenthi Lehyam (RL) for 
the treatment of lung cancer. Two lung cancer cell lines (A-549 and H-460) and 
one normal bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cell line were used to test the 
chemotherapeutic effect of RL. Out of five fractions of RL, chloroform fraction 
of RL (cRL) demonstrated a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and 
induction of apoptosis in A-549 and H-460 cells but not in normal BEAS-2B cells. 
The cRL fraction up-regulated the pro-apoptotic genes p53 and Bax and induced 
caspase-3 activation, and down-regulated the pro-survival gene Bcl-2 in both the 
lung cancer cell lines. Also, nuclear export of p53 was seen in cRL-treated lung 
cancer cells. In addition, cRL induced G2/M arrest of cell cycle and enhanced 
the radio-sensitivity of both the lung cancer cell lines. This study suggests 
that cRL may prove to be a potent anti-cancer agent that may be used for the 
treatment of lung cancer. However, further studies are required to bring cRL 
into the mainstream of medicine in the treatment of lung cancer.
