Herbs have been used for medicinal purposes, including the treatment of 
diabetes, for centuries. Plants containing flavonoids are used to treat diabetes 
in Indian medicine and the green tea flavonoid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), 
is reported to have glucose-lowering effects in animals. We show here that the 
regulation of hepatic glucose production is decreased by EGCG. Furthermore, like 
insulin, EGCG increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and 
insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and it reduces phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxykinase gene expression in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner. 
EGCG also mimics insulin by increasing phosphoinositide 3-kinase, 
mitogen-activated protein kinase, and p70(s6k) activity. EGCG differs from 
insulin, however, in that it affects several insulin-activated kinases with 
slower kinetics. Furthermore, EGCG regulates genes that encode gluconeogenic 
enzymes and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation by modulating the redox state of 
the cell. These results demonstrate that changes in the redox state may have 
beneficial effects for the treatment of diabetes and suggest a potential role 
for EGCG, or derivatives, as an antidiabetic agent.
