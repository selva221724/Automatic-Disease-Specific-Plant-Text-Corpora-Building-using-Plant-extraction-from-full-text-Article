The phenanthroindolizidine plant alkaloids pergularinine (PGL) and 
tylophorinidine (TPD) isolated from the Indian medicinal herb Pergularia pallida 
have been evaluated for their biological activity and assessed for the first 
time employing dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (5,6,7,8-THF: NADP(+) 
oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) as the probe in the present investigations. The 
enzyme is a key target in cancer chemotherapy and has been purified from 
Lactobacillus leichmannii. Cytotoxicity studies showed that both PGL and TPD are 
potently toxic and inhibited the growth of L. leichmannii cells (IC(50)=45 and 
40 microM, respectively). Both the alkaloids significantly inhibited DHFR 
activity (IC(50)=40 and 32 microM for PGL and TPD, respectively). Alkaloid 
concentrations greater than 75-95 microM resulted in a complete loss of DHFR 
activity. Our results are suggestive of the alkaloids as potential antimicrobial 
and antitumour compounds. Alkaloid binding to DHFR is slow and reversible. 
Inhibition kinetics revealed K(i) values of 9x10(-6) M and 7x10(-6) M for PGL 
and TPD, respectively for the enzyme and inhibition in both the cases was a 
simple linear 'non-competitive' type.
