A new cancer cell growth inhibitor designated pedilstatin (1) was isolated from 
a Republic of Maldives Pedilanthus sp. The structure was determined to be 
13-O-acetyl-12-O-[2'Z,4'E-octadienoyl]-4alpha-deoxyphorbol on the basis of 
high-resolution mass spectral and 2D NMR assignments. Pedilstatin was found to 
significantly inhibit growth of the P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line with an 
ED(50) of 0.28 microg/mL, to afford, at concentrations of 2-5 microM, protection 
(to 80%) of human-derived lymphoblastoid CEM-SS cells from infection and 
cell-killing by HIV-1, and to show inhibition of protein kinase C with a K(i) of 
620 +/- 20 nM.
