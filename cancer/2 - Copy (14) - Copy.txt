Three cytogenetic endpoints were studied in non-chewing healthy controls and 3 
groups of tobacco-areca nut chewers, viz. normal chewers, chewers with oral 
submucous fibrosis and chewers with oral cancer. Frequencies of sister-chromatid 
exchanges and chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes and of 
micronucleated cells in exfoliated buccal mucosa were evaluated. All the 
parameters showed statistically significant elevations in all 3 groups of 
chewers compared to the controls. The data indicate possible application of the 
parameters as sensitive endpoints for monitoring tobacco-areca nut chewers, the 
group of individuals at higher risk of developing oral cancer, the commonest 
cancer among Indian males.
