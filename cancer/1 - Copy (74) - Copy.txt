Withaferin A, a steroidal lactone isolated from the roots of the Indian 
medicinal plant Withania somnifera, reduced survival of V79 cells in a 
dose-dependent manner. LD50 for survival was 16 microM. One-hour treatment with 
a non-toxic dose of 2.1 microM before irradiation significantly enhanced cell 
killing, giving a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.5 for 37% survival and 
1.4 for 10% survival. SER increased with drug dose, but at higher doses the 
increased lethality appears to be due to two effects-- drug toxicity and 
radiosensitization. The drug induced a G2/M block, with a maximum accumulation 
of cells in G2-M phase at 4 h after treatment with 10.5 microM withaferin A in 1 
h. The applicability of this drug as a radiosensitizer in cancer therapy needs 
to be explored.
