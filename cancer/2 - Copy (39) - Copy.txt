Withania somnifera is a medicinal plant used in the treatment of a variety of 
ailments in the Ayurvedic system. Alcoholic extract of the root of the plant was 
injected(ip) at daily doses of 200 to 1000 mg/kg body wt for 15 days starting 
from 24 hr after intradermal inoculation of 5 x 10(5) cells of S-180 in BALB/c 
mice. Solid tumor growth was monitored for 100 days. Doses of 400 mg/kg and 
above produced complete regression of tumor after an initial growth, the 
percentage of complete response (CR) increasing with increasing drug dose. A 55% 
CR was obtained at 1000 mg/kg drug administration, but this dose also produced 
some mortality among the animals. A significant increase in the volume doubling 
time and growth delay was seen when the drug dose was increased from 500 to 750 
mg/kg body wt, but further increase in drug dose to 1000 mg/kg did not produce 
any significant increase in these responses. Cumulative doses of 7.5 to 10 g at 
daily doses of 500 or 750 mg/kg seems to produce a good response in this tumor.
