Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) is a perennial succulent medicinal plant. It 
has been used as a traditional or folk medicine for thousands of years and 
claimed that it possesses wound and burn healing activities, and 
anti-inflammatory as well as immunomodulatory effects. In recent years, the use 
of Aloe vera has been growing as a dietary supplement. The pre-clinical studies 
over the last couple of decades uncover the potential therapeutic activities of 
Aloe vera and its bioactive compounds, especially against neoplastic disease. 
Such investigations indicate the possible preventive as well as therapeutic 
effects of Aloe vera against cancer. Here, we discuss the crucial bioactive 
compounds of Aloe vera that have been harnessed against cancer and also address 
several mechanisms of action of these lead bioactive compounds compared to other 
standard drugs involved in cancer prevention and treatment.
