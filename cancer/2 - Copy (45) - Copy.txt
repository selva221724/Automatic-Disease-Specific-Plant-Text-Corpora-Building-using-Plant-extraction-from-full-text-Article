Paste made out of an instant betel nut preparation was painted into the oral 
cavity of 21 albino rats on alternate days for a period of six months. Biopsies 
were taken from the oral mucosa at the beginning of the study and every two 
months there after and compared histopathologically with those obtained from a 
control group of 14 albino rats. Mild to moderate loss of nuclear polarity and 
increase in keratoses, parakeratoses, inflammatory cell infiltration and 
vascularity were noted when compared to the control group. The increase in 
mitotic figures was statistically insignificant and no definite changes in 
pigmentation or atypical cells were seen. These findings suggest the possibility 
of mild leukoplakia. Submucosal collagen increased steeply and steadily 
throughout the study period and at the end of six months, 88.23 per cent of 
biopsies showed thickened and condensed sub-mucosal collagen, indicating 
submucous fibrosis.
