Due to the increased use of ionizing radiation in various aspects of human life 
especially in areas pertaining to radiotherapy of cancer, food preservation, 
agriculture, industry and power generation, there is a need to develop an 
effective and non-toxic radioprotector. The currently available ones have many 
drawbacks including high cost, side effects and toxicity. Several novel 
approaches are on to locate a potent radioprotector. These include mimics of 
antioxidant enzymes, nitroxides, melatonin, growth factors, gene therapy, 
hyperthermia apart from natural products. The latter has several advantages 
since they are non-toxic with proven therapeutic benefits. These can be 
classified as natural compounds and plant extracts; polyherbal formulations; 
besides natural and semi-natural compounds of plant origin. A review of the 
above agents, their efficacy in radioprotection and possible mechanisms 
responsible has been carried out. As India and many Eastern countries have an 
enormous heritage of vast natural dietary and time tested medicinal resources it 
is worth exploring the possibility of developing efficient, economically viable 
and clinically acceptable radioprotectors for human application from these 
resources.
