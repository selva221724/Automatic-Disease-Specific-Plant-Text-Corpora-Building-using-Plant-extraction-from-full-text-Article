Chromosome-damaging activity of saliva of betel nut and tobacco chewers.

Saliva of volunteers chewing betel quid, cured betel nut (Areca catechu), betel 
leaves (Piper betle), a mixture of quid ingredients (dried betel nut flakes, 
catechu, cardamon, lime, copra and menthol) and Indian tobacco was collected and 
examined for its genotoxic activity. Chromosome aberrations (chromatid breaks 
and chromatid exchanges) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used to 
estimate the genotoxic effect. No detectable levels of clastogenic activity were 
observed in the saliva of non-chewing individuals. After 5 min of chewing betel 
quid, betel nut, betel leaves, quid ingredients and Indian tobacco, the saliva 
samples showed relatively potent clastogenic activities. The addition of 
transition metals Mn2+ and Cu2+ to the saliva samples of betel nut and Indian 
tobacco chewers enhanced their clastogenic activities, whereas Fe3+ increased 
the clastogenicity of the betel nut saliva but decreased the genotoxic effect of 
the saliva of Indian tobacco chewers. After removal of the betel quid or its 
components from the mouth, the clastogenic activity disappeared within 5 min. 
The western-type chewing tobacco did not produce a genotoxic activity in the 
saliva of chewers. A possible association between the genotoxicity in the saliva 
of betel quid chewers and the development of oral, pharyngeal and esophageal 
carcinomas is discussed.
