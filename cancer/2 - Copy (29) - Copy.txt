ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Glycosmis pentaphylla (Retz.) Correa is used in 
Indian traditional medicine against jaundice and other liver disorders.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aims to determine the in vitro anticancer and 
apoptosis inducing activity of Glycosmis pentaphylla in hepatocellular carcinoma 
cell line, Hep3 B.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing activity of the 
crude extract and active fractions were estimated on Hep3 B and RAW264.7 cell 
lines by MTT assay, Hoechst staining, DNA fragmentation, morphological studies, 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and 
anti-poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase assays. The phytochemical profiling of active 
extract was done by TLC and HPTLC methods.
RESULTS: Ethanol extract of Glycosmis pentaphylla was more effective than other 
extracts in reducing the proliferation of Hep3 B cells. As revealed by the 
results from DNA fragmentation, Hoechst staining, morphological studies, RT-PCR, 
PARP cleavage and gene expression studies, active extract induced apoptosis on 
Hep3 B cell line in concentration and time dependent manner with increase in the 
Bax/Bcl2 gene expression ratio. Chemo profiling data revealed the presence of 
flavonoid in the active fraction.
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that major active component in the ethanol extract 
of Glycosmis pentaphylla is a flavonoid which induces apoptosis on cancer cell 
line, Hep3 B, by increasing the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl2 genes in a time and 
dose dependent manner.
