Andrographis paniculata (AP) treatment prevents BHC induced increase in the 
activities of enzymes y-Glutamyl transpeptidase, glutathione-S-transferase and 
lipid peroxidation. The activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide 
dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and the levels of glutathione were 
decreased following BHC effect. Administration of AP showed protective effects 
in the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, 
glutathione reductase as well the level of glutathione. The activity of lipid 
peroxidase was also decreased. The result indicate antioxidant and 
hepatoprotective action of A. paniculata.
