Diallyl sulfide (C6H10S, DAS) is one of the novel natural organosulfur 
compounds, which is mostly obtained from the genus Allium plants. Numerous 
studies have revealed several unique properties of DAS in terms of its 
health-promoting effects. DAS has proved to be anticancer, antimicrobial, 
anti-angiogenic, and immunomodulatory like unique functions as demonstrated by 
the multiple investigations. Diallyl sulfide can also impede oxidative stress 
and chronic inflammation as suggested by the literature. Studies also explored 
that DAS could thwart the development of chronic diseases like cancer, neuronal, 
cardiovascular disease through modulating mechanistic pathways involved in 
pathogenesis. In this book chapter, we have attempted to give the comprehensive 
view on DAS about the physiochemical and biological properties, and its 
preventive role in chronic diseases with a mechanistic overview.
