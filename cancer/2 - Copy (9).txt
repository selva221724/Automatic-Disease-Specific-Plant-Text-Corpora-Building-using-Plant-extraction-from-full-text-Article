The CH3OH-CH2Cl2 extract of an Indian collection (entire plant) of Gynandropsis 
gynandra (L.) Briq. was separated based on bioassay results employing cancer 
cell lines. Six cancer cell growth inhibitors were isolated and found to be 
known flavone apegenin (4) and flavonols 1-3, 5, and 6. The structure of 
flavonol 2 was confirmed by X-ray crystal structure determination. All of the 
five flavonols (1-3, 5, 6) inhibited the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell 
line with ED50 values of 3.0, 9.2, 4.0, 0.37, and 3.9 microg/ml, respectively. 
All six of the flavonoids (1-6) also exhibited activity against a panel of six 
human cancer cell lines. Penduletin (3) inhibited growth of the Gram-negative 
pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae and apegenin (4) inhibited growth of the 
Gram-positive opportunist Enterococcus faecalis.
