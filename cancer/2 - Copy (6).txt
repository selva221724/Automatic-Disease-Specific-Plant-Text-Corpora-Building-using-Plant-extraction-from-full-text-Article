Considerable attention has been focused on plants which are sources of natural 
anti-oxidant compounds, because most of them have a modulatory role on 
physiological functions and biotransformation reactions involved in the 
detoxification process. Such compounds are likely to afford protection from 
cytotoxic, genotoxic and metabolic actions of environmental toxicant thereby 
reducing the risk for cancer. The present study reports the anticarcinogenic 
activity of Swertia chirata Buch.Ham, an Indian medicinal plant. All the four 
detoxification enzymes studied viz, GST, GPx, SOD and CAT were found to be 
activated in different degrees following treatment with infusion of Swertia 
chirata, its crude extract and a purified 'Amarogentin' rich extract. The 
activation of the enzymes was accompanied by significant reduction in lipid 
peroxidation and inhibition of incidence as well as multiplicity of 
Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced papillomas. The effect of S.chirata on 
apoptosis and cell proliferation was also studied in mice skin exposed to DMBA. 
Both the crude and purified extracts significantly inhibited cell proliferation 
and induced apoptosis. This is the fi rst report of its kind and the observation 
suggests the chemopreventive potential of Swertia chirata.
