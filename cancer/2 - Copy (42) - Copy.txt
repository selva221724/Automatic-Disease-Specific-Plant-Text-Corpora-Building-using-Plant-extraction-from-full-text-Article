The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in Malaysia was determined by examining a 
representative sample of 11,707 subjects aged 25 years and above throughout the 
14 states over a period of 5 months during 1993/1994. A two-stage stratified 
random sampling was undertaken. A predetermined number of enumeration blocks, 
the smallest population unit in the census publication, was selected from each 
state. With the selected enumeration block, a systematic sample of living 
quarters was chosen with a random start. The survey instrument included a 
questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics and a clinical examination. 
The clinical examination was carried out by 16 specially trained dental public 
health officers and the diagnosis calibrated with a final concordance rate of 
92%. The age in the sample ranged from 25 to 115 years with a mean of 
44.5+/-14.0. The sample comprised 40.2% males and 59.8% females; 55.8% were 
Malays, 29.4% Chinese, 10.0% Indians and 1.2% other ethnic groups. Oral mucosal 
lesions were detected in 1131 (9.7%) subjects, 5 (0.04%) had oral cancer, 165 
(1.4%) had lesions or conditions that may be precancerous (leukoplakia, 
erythroplakia, submucous fibrosis and lichen planus) and 187 (1.6%) had betel 
chewer's mucosa. The prevalence of oral precancer was highest amongst Indians 
(4.0%) and other Bumiputras (the indigenous people of Sabah and Sarawak) (2.5%) 
while the lowest prevalence was amongst the Chinese (0.5%).
