Areca nut: a review.

Arjungi KN.

Areca cattechu Linn is commonly known as areca nut or betel nut. It is a very 
widely cultivated plant in eastern countries like India, Bangladesh, Ceylon, 
Malaya, the Philippines and Japan. The importance of this nut is due to its use 
for chewing purposes. It had an important place as a pharmaceutical in 
Ayurveda--the ancient Indian system of medicine--also in the Chinese medicinal 
practices. The pharmaceutical importance of areca nut is due to the presence of 
an alkaloid, arecoline. Synthetic arecoline hydrobromide is also shown to 
possess numerous pharmacological properties. Chewing of "betel quid" or areca 
nut is a typical oriental habit. Betel quid comprises betel leaf, areca nut, 
catechu, lime and sometimes also tobacco. It is shown that there exists a 
correlationship between betel quid or areca nut chewing habit and oral cancer. A 
number of investigators have been able to produce cellular changes such as 
leukoplakia by application of betel quid or areca nut extract to the buccal 
mucosa of different animal.
