INTRODUCTION: MMPs are metal-dependant endopeptidases capable of degrading any 
one of the components of the extracellular matrix. In normal physiological 
conditions it is regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, and any 
alteration in this regulatory process leads to pathological conditions.
AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the status of MMP research in India. The 
first research paper was published in 1998; the subsequent developments in this 
field led to an increase in the number of publications. This review highlights 
the growth of MMP research in India based on the research papers published from 
1998 to 2010. We identify four major subject areas: cancer, arthritis, ulcer and 
quantitative structure-activity relationship. The diseases involved are 
discussed along with the required steps for improving treatments.
EXPERT OPINION: Indian researchers need to work on new molecules with specific 
MMP inhibitory activity for cancer and communicable and geriatric diseases. 
Although several publications on natural products have appeared from India, they 
are very few considering the number of medicinal plants available in the 
country. Inhibiting MMPs could be both beneficial and detrimental to cells, 
owing to the inter-relationship between normal physiology and pathology; thus, 
targeting MMPs with broad MMP inhibitors can have mixed blessings.
