BACKGROUND: Betel quid chewing, often combined with tobacco chewing, is a common 
habit in the Indian subcontinent. It is associated with the development of 
malignancy of the oral mucosa and foregut. Among Asian communities in the United 
Kingdom (UK), Bangladeshis are particularly likely to retain this habit.
AIM: To investigate the prevalence of betel quid chewing, smoking, and knowledge 
of health hazards associated with these habits among the Bangladeshi population 
in an east London general practice.
METHOD: A bilingual postal questionnaire to all 306 adults (25 years and over) 
identified as being of Bangladeshi origin within one practice in east London.
RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate was 46%. The prevalence of betel quid 
chewing was over 80% with no sex difference. Men were more likely to smoke 
tobacco than women (men = 57%, women = 11%, X2 = 33.3, P < 0.001), but over half 
the women added tobacco to their quid for chewing. Whereas over 80% of both male 
and female respondents identified the health risk of smoking, only one third 
identified oral cancer as a risk. In all, 25% of respondents started chewing in 
the UK.
CONCLUSIONS: The low response rate is discussed. The findings indicate that the 
majority of Bangladeshi respondents are unaware of the health risks of a common 
social habit, although well informed about smoking risks. A government health 
warning should be introduced for betel quid sold in the UK.
