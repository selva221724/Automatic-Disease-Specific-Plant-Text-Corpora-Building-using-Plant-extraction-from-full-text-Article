Lupeol, present in fruits and medicinal plants, is a biologically active 
compound that has been shown to have various pharmacological properties in 
experimental studies. In the present study, we demonstrated the modulatory 
effect of lupeol on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced alterations on 
cell proliferation in the skin of Swiss albino mice. Lupeol treatment showed 
significant (p < 0.05) preventive effects with marked inhibition at 48, 72, and 
96 h against DMBA-mediated neoplastic events. Cell-cycle analysis showed that 
lupeol-induced G2/M-phase arrest (16-37%) until 72 h, and these inhibitory 
effects were mediated through inhibition of the cyclin-B-regulated signaling 
pathway involving p53, p21/WAF1, cdc25C, cdc2, and cyclin-B gene expression. 
Further lupeol-induced apoptosis was observed, as shown by an increased sub-G1 
peak (28%) at 96 h, with upregulation of bax and caspase-3 genes and 
downregulation of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 and survivin genes. Thus, our results 
indicate that lupeol has novel anti-proliferative and apoptotic potential that 
may be helpful in designing strategies to fight skin cancer.
