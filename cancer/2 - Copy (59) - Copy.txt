Flavonolignans isolated from Hydnocarpus wightiana seeds, namely hydnowightin, 
hydnocarpin, and neohydnocarpin, demonstrated potent hypolipidemic activity in 
mice, lowering both serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels at 8 mg/kg/day ip. 
Hydnowightin demonstrated the best lipid-lowering effect of the three compounds. 
Good anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activity was demonstrated by 
hydnocarpin in mice in vivo. The other two derivatives were not as active in 
these screens. Cytotoxicity against the growth of murine and human tissue 
cultured cells was shown. All three compounds were moderately active against 
murine L-1210 leukemia growth. All three compounds demonstrated good activity 
against the growth of human KB nasopharynx, colon adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, 
and HeLa-S3 uterine growth. Hydnocarpin was the only compound of the three which 
was active against glioma growth. Hydnocarpin and neohydnocarpin demonstrated 
significant activity against Tmolt3 leukemia cell growth.
