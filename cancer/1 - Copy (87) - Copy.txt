Study of antitumor and radiosensitizing properties of W. somnifera 
(Ashwagandha), a well known medicinal plant, have yielded encouraging results. 
The alcoholic extract of the dried roots of the plant as well as the active 
component withaferin A isolated from the extract showed significant antitumor 
and radiosensitizing effects in experimental tumors in vivo, without any 
noticeable systemic toxicity. Withaferin A gave a sensitizer enhancement ratio 
of 1.5 for in vitro cell killing of V79 Chinese hamster cells at a non toxic 
concentration of approximately 2 microM. The mechanism of action of this 
compound is not known. The studies so far indicate that W. somnifera could prove 
to be a good natural source of a potent and relatively safe 
radiosensitizer/chemotherapeutic agent. Further studies are needed to explore 
the clinical potential of this plant for cancer therapy.
