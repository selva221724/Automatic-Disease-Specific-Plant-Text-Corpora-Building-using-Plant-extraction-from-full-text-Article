Panel on epidemiology and etiology of laryngeal carcinoma.

Ours is a developing country. We have still not controlled the common infectious 
diseases which are extinct in the West; therefore, our limited resources are 
spent on study of epidemiology of infectious diseases. My conclusions on 
epidemiology of cancer of the larynx are drawn from observations made of the 
clinical material over a period of 25 years. I have come to the conclusion that 
the smoked tobacco and the slaked lime in the Indian "Pan" are the two important 
carcinogenic agents. Poor nutrition appears to be carcinogenic. It requires 
study and confirmation at a cellular level. Misuse of voice does seem to be the 
cause of laryngeal cancer. Racial, genetic and other environmental factors, 
including pollution have not contributed to the increased incidence of laryngeal 
cancers. The common histological types of laryngeal cancer are known. My 
observations on certain biological behavior of the tumor have been helpful. 1. 
An exophytic growth is less infiltrative; its metastatic mass reflects the same 
characteristics. 2. Certain anaplastic tumors can flout all laws of cancer 
spread and metastasize in distal organs. 3. Presence of reticular hyperplasia in 
peripheral lymph nodes is of good prognostic value.
