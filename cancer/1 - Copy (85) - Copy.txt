While perhaps best known for their advanced calendars and knowledge of 
astronomy, the Maya also developed an advanced pharmaceutical science that has 
been maintained by their descendants. Because of the diverse habitats found in 
the region, from mountains to deep valleys, the complex ecosystem of the 
highland Maya is the world's third richest in numbers of vascular plant species. 
The rain forests of this area are a rich source of potential new drugs. 
According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, more than 25% of the 
ingredients in today's cancer medicines were either discovered in rain forests 
or are analogues or derivatives of such compounds. Although much of the Mayan 
medical knowledge continues to be practiced by their descendants, the Mayan 
medical traditions are fading because of increased urbanization. Meanwhile, the 
source of their pharmacopeia is disappearing as the tropical rain forests are 
cleared for development. Consequently, measures to preserve this pharmaceutical 
knowledge are of great importance.
