Nimbolide (1), a limonoid isolated from Azadirachta indica, is the chief 
cytotoxic principle in Neem leaves extract. Using nimbolide as a lead compound 
for anti-cancer analogue design, a series of nimbolide derivatives have been 
synthesized and evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activity against a panel of 
human cancer cell lines. Out of 10 compounds screened 2g, 2h and 2i showed 
potent activity.
