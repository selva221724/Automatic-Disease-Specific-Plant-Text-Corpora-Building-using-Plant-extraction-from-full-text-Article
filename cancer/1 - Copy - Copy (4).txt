Curcumin is a substance obtained from the root of the turmeric plant, which has 
the feature of being a yellow or orange pigment. It is also the main component 
of curry powder commonly used in Asian cuisine. Curcumin, a substance that has 
had an important place in traditional Indian and Chinese medicines for thousands 
of years, has been the center of interest for scientific studies especially in 
the field of cancer treatment for several years. Laboratory studies have 
presented some favorable results in terms of curcumin's antioxidant, 
antiinflammatory and anticancer properties in particular. However, since such 
findings have yet to be confirmed in clinical studies, its effect on humans is 
not clearly known. Therefore, when its advantages in terms of toxicity, cost and 
availability as well as the favorable results achieved in laboratory studies are 
considered, it would not be wrong to say that curcumin is a substance worth 
being studied. However, for now the most correct approach is to abstain from its 
use for medical purposes due to lack of adequate reliable evidence obtained from 
clinical studies, and because of its potential to interfere with other drugs.
