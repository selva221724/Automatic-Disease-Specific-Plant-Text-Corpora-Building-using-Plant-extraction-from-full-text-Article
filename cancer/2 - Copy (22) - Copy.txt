From the petroleum ether extract of the root bark of Salacia Oblonga wall, two 
biologically active fractions have been isolated by column and thin layer 
chromatography. The methanol eluted fraction of the extract absorbed on a column 
of silica gel at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml showed 100 percent 
cytotoxicity on Ehrlich ascites tumour cells. The chloroform eluted fraction of 
the pet. ether extract and a fluorescent compound separated from it by TLC 
demonstrated about 60% and 76% hypoglycemic potency of an equal dose of 
tolbutamide (250 mg/kg) in albino rats. The results indicate the therapeutic 
importance of S. Oblonga wall.
