At the Faculties of Dentistry in Chiang Mai, Thailand (CM), and Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia (KL), 234 and 233 consecutive out-patients of mean ages 33.8 and 31.0 
yr, respectively, were examined for the presence of oral mucosal lesions. 
Tobacco in some form was regularly used by 31.7% and 27.5% of the study 
populations in CM and KL, respectively. Cigarette smoking was the predominant 
habit. In CM three persons chewed betel quids and nine smoked banana leaf cigars 
daily. In addition, there were 24 habitual chewers of tea leaves (miang). In KL 
six persons chewed betel quids daily. In CM and KL three cases each (1.3%) of 
tobacco-associated leukoplakias were found. In KL an additional idiopathic 
leukoplakia was registered. One and three cases of betel related lesions were 
found in CM and KL, respectively. One case of a squamous cell carcinoma was 
found in a 45-yr-old Indian woman in KL who had been chewing betel with tobacco 
daily for many years. High prevalence figures were found for lichen planus, 3.8% 
in CM and 2.1% in KL, and an extremely high one, 48.3%, in CM for episodes of 
aphthous ulcers experienced during the last 2 yr. Comparatively low prevalence 
figures were found for herpes labialis. As could be expected melanin 
pigmentation was prevalent while only low figures were encountered for 
denture-related lesions and amalgam tattoos.
