Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) affects an estimated 2.5 million people, mostly in 
the Indian subcontinent. Limitation of oral opening resulting in difficulty in 
eating is the main presenting feature. Although nutritional deficiencies and 
immunological processes may play a part in the pathogenesis, the available 
epidemiological evidence indicates that chewing betel quid (containing areca 
nut, tobacco, slaked lime or other species) is an important risk factor for OSF. 
Genetically determined susceptibility could explain why only a small fraction of 
those using betel quid develop the disease. In OSF there is an incidence of oral 
cancer of 7.6 per cent for a median 10-year follow-up period. Risk markers for 
malignant transformation in OSF include epithelial dysplasia, silver binding 
nucleolar organizer region counts, and sister-chromatid exchange frequencies; 
p53 tumour suppressor gene mutations may be involved in these potentially 
malignant changes.
