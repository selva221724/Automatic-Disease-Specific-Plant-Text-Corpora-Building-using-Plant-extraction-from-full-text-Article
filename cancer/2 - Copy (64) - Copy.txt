The chemopreventive role of an Indian medicinal plant Mikania cordata 
(Compositae), which is consumed as vegetable and advocated in folk-medicine, has 
been evaluated through its effects on Phase 1 and 2 of the hepatic 
drug-detoxifying enzyme system in rats. Although oral administration of a 
methanolic extract of this plant root (50, 100 or 150 mg/kg for 4, 8 or 12 
weeks) has been found to have very little or no effect on hepatic microsomal 
cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5 contents as well as NADPH cytochrome c 
reductase activity, it afforded a marked induction of uridine 
diphosphoglucuronyl transferase activities of liver microsomes. The extract also 
significantly increased the activities of microsomal uridine diphosphoglucose 
dehydrogenase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate): quinine 
reductase and cytosolic glutathione s-transferases with a concomittant elevation 
in the contents of reduced glutathione. All these effects were found to be 
dose-dependent and maintained during 12 weeks of the extract treatment. Results 
of the study clearly indicate that the intracellular contents of active 
intermediates of various xenobiotics including chemical carcinogens would be 
reduced by the specific enhancement of drug-detoxifying enzymes in the liver of 
rats treated with the plant extract.
