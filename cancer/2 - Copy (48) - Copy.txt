When administered orally, Phyllanthus emblica, an excellent source of vitamin C 
(ascorbate), has been found to enhance natural killer (NK) cell activity and 
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in syngeneic BALB/c mice, 
bearing Dalton's lymphoma ascites (DLA) tumor. P. emblica elicited a 2-fold 
increase in splenic NK cell activity on day 3 post tumor inoculation. Enhanced 
activity was highly significant on days 3, 5, 7 and 9 after tumor inoculation 
with respect to the untreated tumor bearing control. A significant enhancement 
in ADCC was documented on days 3, 7, 9, 11 and 13 in drug treated mice as 
compared to the control. An increase in life span (ILS) of 35% was recorded in 
tumor bearing mice treated with P. emblica. This increased survival was 
completely abrogated when NK cell and killer (K) cell activities were depleted 
either by cyclophosphamide or anti-asialo-GM1 antibody treatment. These results 
indicate: (a) an absolute requirement for a functional NK cell or K cell 
population in order that P. emblica can exert its effect on tumor bearing 
animals, and (b) the antitumor activity of P. emblica is mediated primarily 
through the ability of the drug to augment natural cell mediated cytotoxicity.
