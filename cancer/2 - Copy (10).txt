The activity of thymidylate synthase (TS) purified in our laboratory from 
Lactobacillus leichmannii was inhibited by pergularinine (PGL) and 
tylophorinidine (TPD) and deoxytubulosine (DTB) isolated from the Indian 
medicinal plants Pergularia pallida and Alangium lamarckii respectively. 
Cytotoxicity studies showed that cell growth of L. leichmannii was inhibited 
(IC50 = 40-45 microM) by all the three alkaloids, the concentrations > 80-90 
microM resulting in complete loss of the enzyme activity. Ki values of the 
enzyme calculated from Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots for PGL, TPD and DTB were 
10 x 10(-6) M, 9 x 10(-6) M and 7 x 10(-6) M respectively. These are typed as 
'non-competitive' inhibitors of TS. All the three alkaloids inhibited (IC50 = 50 
microM) the elevated TS activity of leukocytes in cancer patients with 
clinically diagnosed chronic myelocytic leukemia (n = 10), acute lymphocytic 
leukemia (n = 8) and metastatic solid tumours (n = 3).
