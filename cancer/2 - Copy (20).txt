In vitro immunostimulatory effect of Abrus lectins derived peptide fractions 
(AGP and ABP) was investigated in DL bearing mice. Both AGP and ABP were found 
to activate splenocytes and induced production of cytokines like IL-2, IFN-gamma 
and TNF-alpha indicating a Th1 type of immune response. Analysis of in vitro 
treated splenocytes by flow cytometry revealed an increase in percentage of T 
and B cell with high expression of activation markers (CD25(+) and CD71(+)). At 
the same time, expression of co-stimulatory markers was significantly high 
compared to tumor control. The tumor associated macrophages were able to 
stimulate NO production, IL-1 secretion, increased phagocytosis and decreased 
expression of mannose receptor. It was also observed that NK cell was activated 
by AGP and ABP. These results suggest that both AGP and ABP act as 
immunostimulants in vitro in DL bearing mice.
