This review, containing over 276 references, covers the progress made in the 
chemistry and bioactivity of this important group of triterpenoids. Though 
initially known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activities 
through a unique 5-LO inhibition mechanism, boswellic acids have recently 
attained significance due to their anti-cancer properties. The phytochemistry 
and chemical modifications, including mechanism of action, are discussed.
