Barringtonia racemosa has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment 
of various diseases. The antitumor property of the seed extract of this plant in 
mice model promotes us to search for the active component present in the fruit 
extract. Quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (QOR) has been isolated from the fruits of 
this plant for the first time and quantified by HPLC method. The compound was 
identified by IR, mass, and NMR (1D, 2D) spectral data analysis. QOR showed 
dose- and time-dependent anti-proliferative activity in several leukemic cell 
lines with negligible effect on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
(PBMC). A representative T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line 
(MOLT-3) showed phosphatidyl serine externalization and DNA fragmentation, 
indicating QOR-induced programmed cell death. We established that QOR-induced 
apoptosis occurred preferentially on accumulation of cells in the sub-G(0) phase 
and genomic DNA fragmentation through the activation of mitochondria-dependent 
caspase cascade for the first time in T-lineage ALL cell line.
