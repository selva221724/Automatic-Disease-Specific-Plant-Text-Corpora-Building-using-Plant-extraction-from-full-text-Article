Pan masala (PM), a dried powdered mixture containing ingredients like areca nut, 
catechu, lime, cardamom and flavouring agents, is consumed abundantly by Indians 
and is also exported to Western countries. Pan masala with tobacco (PM-T) is 
also available on the market. In view of the role of the ingredients of PM in 
the causation of oral diseases, the possible harmful effects of consuming this 
complex mixture were analysed in individuals regularly consuming PM and among 
healthy non-consuming controls without any habit. Three cytogenetic endpoints 
and two tissues were employed to assess possible DNA damage. Sister chromatid 
exchange and chromosome aberrations were estimated in the peripheral blood 
lymphocytes, tissues indirectly exposed to the substance and the frequency of 
micronucleated cells was scored in the tissue directly in contact with PM, i.e. 
the exfoliated buccal mucosa cells. All three cytogenetic endpoints demonstrated 
a statistically significant increase (P less than 0.001) among the PM consumers 
as compared with the non-consuming controls.
