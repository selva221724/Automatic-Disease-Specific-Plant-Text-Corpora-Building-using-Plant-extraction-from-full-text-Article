Withania somnifera, also called 'Indian ginseng', is an important medicinal 
plant of the Indian subcontinent. It is widely used, singly or in combination, 
with other herbs against many ailments in Indian Systems of Medicine since time 
immemorial. Withania somnifera contains a spectrum of diverse phytochemicals 
enabling it to have a broad range of biological implications. In preclinical 
studies, it has shown anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, 
anti-stress, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-diabetic properties. 
Additionally, it has demonstrated the ability to reduce reactive oxygen species, 
modulate mitochondrial function, regulate apoptosis, and reduce inflammation and 
enhance endothelial function. In view of these pharmacologic properties, W. 
somnifera is a potential drug candidate to treat various clinical conditions, 
particularly related to the nervous system. In this review, we summarize the 
pharmacologic characteristics and discuss the mechanisms of action and potential 
therapeutic applications of the plant and its active constituents.

Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) is a perennial succulent medicinal plant. It 
has been used as a traditional or folk medicine for thousands of years and 
claimed that it possesses wound and burn healing activities, and 
anti-inflammatory as well as immunomodulatory effects. In recent years, the use 
of Aloe vera has been growing as a dietary supplement. The pre-clinical studies 
over the last couple of decades uncover the potential therapeutic activities of 
Aloe vera and its bioactive compounds, especially against neoplastic disease. 
Such investigations indicate the possible preventive as well as therapeutic 
effects of Aloe vera against cancer. Here, we discuss the crucial bioactive 
compounds of Aloe vera that have been harnessed against cancer and also address 
several mechanisms of action of these lead bioactive compounds compared to other 
standard drugs involved in cancer prevention and treatment.

Aegle marmelos Linn. (Rutaceae), commonly known as "bael" in Nepal and India, is 
a valuable medicinal plant and is considered sacred by the Hindus. It is used to 
cure several diseases in the Indian traditional medicine system of Ayurveda and 
has had similar uses among many ethnic communities residing in Indian 
subcontinent for over 5000 years. Its leaves, bark, stem, fruits and seeds have 
been used for various medicinal purposes. Bael fruits are especially effective 
in the treatment of chronic diarrhea, dysentery and peptic ulcers, while they 
are also useful as a laxative and cure for respiratory infections. Scientific 
studies have validated many of the ethnomedicinal uses of A. marmelos, which 
include antibacterial, antiviral, antidiarrheal, gastroprotective, 
anti-ulcerative colitis, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, cardioprotective and 
radioprotective effects. Recently, this plant has also received attention as an 
anticancer agent for the treatment of various types of cancers. Thus, this 
review focuses on scientific evidence verifying the important pharmacological 
activity such as antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, 
cardioprotective and anticancer activity of A. marmelos.

Emblica officinalis Gaertn. or Phyllanthus emblica Linn, commonly known as 
Indian gooseberry or amla, is arguably the most important medicinal plant in the 
Indian traditional system of medicine, the Ayurveda. Various parts of the plant 
are used to treat a range of diseases, but the most important is the fruit. The 
fruit is used either alone or in combination with other plants to treat many 
ailments such as common cold and fever; as a diuretic, laxative, liver tonic, 
refrigerant, stomachic, restorative, alterative, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, 
hair tonic; to prevent peptic ulcer and dyspepsia, and as a digestive. 
Preclinical studies have shown that amla possesses antipyretic, analgesic, 
antitussive, antiatherogenic, adaptogenic, cardioprotective, gastroprotective, 
antianemia, antihypercholesterolemia, wound healing, antidiarrheal, 
antiatherosclerotic, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, and neuroprotective 
properties. In addition, experimental studies have shown that amla and some of 
its phytochemicals such as gallic acid, ellagic acid, pyrogallol, some 
norsesquiterpenoids, corilagin, geraniin, elaeocarpusin, and prodelphinidins B1 
and B2 also possess antineoplastic effects. Amla is also reported to possess 
radiomodulatory, chemomodulatory, chemopreventive effects, free radical 
scavenging, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic and immunomodulatory 
activities, properties that are efficacious in the treatment and prevention of 
cancer. This review for the first time summarizes the results related to these 
properties and also emphasizes the aspects that warrant future research to 
establish its activity and utility as a cancer preventive and therapeutic drug 
in humans.

The present work aimed to investigate the anticancer in vitro activity of two 
plants commonly used in traditional Indian medicine: Zingiber officinale Roscoe 
and Nerium oleander L. The extracts of these plants were tested in vitro on 
several human leukemic cell lines, K562, THP-1, MOLT-4 and Jurkat. Cell growth 
inhibition was observed for both plant extracts with 50% inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) values ranging between 1 and 28 μg/mL using SRB 
(sulphorodamine B) and MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl 
tetrazolium bromide] assays. Enhanced cell growth inhibition was observed when 
the extracts were combined with imatinib. Exposed cells showed cell cycle 
arrest, DNA damage and cytochrome c release, indicating that the mechanism of 
cytotoxicity could be via mitochondrial mediated apoptotic pathways. Combination 
of the extracts of these plants with standard cancer treatment may be a way of 
enhancing responses. Clinical studies in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia 
are planned at our center.

Turmeric, derived from the plant Curcuma longa, is a gold-colored spice commonly 
used in the Indian subcontinent, not only for health care but also for the 
preservation of food and as a yellow dye for textiles. Curcumin, which gives the 
yellow color to turmeric, was first isolated almost two centuries ago, and its 
structure as diferuloylmethane was determined in 1910. Since the time of 
Ayurveda (1900 Bc) numerous therapeutic activities have been assigned to 
turmeric for a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including those of the 
skin, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems, aches, pains, wounds, sprains, 
and liver disorders. Extensive research within the last half century has proven 
that most of these activities, once associated with turmeric, are due to 
curcumin. Curcumin has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities and thus has a 
potential against various malignant diseases, diabetes, allergies, arthritis, 
Alzheimer's disease, and other chronic illnesses. These effects are mediated 
through the regulation of various transcription factors, growth factors, 
inflammatory cytokines, protein kinases, and other enzymes. Curcumin exhibits 
activities similar to recently discovered tumor necrosis factor blockers (e.g., 
HUMIRA, REMICADE, and ENBREL), a vascular endothelial cell growth factor blocker 
(e.g., AVASTIN), human epidermal growth factor receptor blockers (e.g., ERBITUX, 
ERLOTINIB, and GEFTINIB), and a HER2 blocker (e.g., HERCEPTIN). Considering the 
recent scientific bandwagon that multitargeted therapy is better than 
monotargeted therapy for most diseases, curcumin can be considered an ideal 
"Spice for Life".

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC (MP) is an ancient 
Indian medicinal plant traditionally used to treat Parkinson's disease. L-Dopa 
(LD), precursor of dopamine is abundantly found in the seeds of MP. L-dopa is a 
natural inhibitor of prolactin (PRL) hormone which is required to maintain 
lactation in women but it's over production (hyperprolactinemia) plays critical 
role in advancement of breast cancer.
AIM OF THE STUDY: We aim to examine the pharmacological effect of LD and MP on 
this hyperprolactinemia associated breast cancer and related signaling for 
effective management of the disease. We also investigated chemo-sensitizing 
effect of MP on hyperprolactinemia-mediated cisplatin resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic seed extract of MP were prepared and analysed 
using HPLC. Effect of LD and MP on the cellular viability of breast cancer cells 
(T47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) were evaluated using MTT assay. 
Further, effect of LD and MP on colony forming potential, DNA damage, cell cycle 
distribution and apoptosis was determined using agar/agarose method, comet assay 
and annexin and PI method followed by FACS analysis. To reveal the molecular 
mechanism involved in the anti-cancer activity of MP, transcriptional and 
translational level analysis of the key proteins involved in the PRL-mediated 
signaling, was performed using RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The effect of 
MP extract on PRL-mediated signaling was validated using dopaminergic agonist 
bromocriptine. MP extract and cisplatin was given in different combination with 
appropriate controls to check their effect on chemo-resistivity of breast cancer 
cells.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that MP seed extract has the potential to 
inhibit cellular proliferation of PRL expressing T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer 
cells via induction of DNA damage, G1 phase of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis 
more effectively as compare to LD. Further, MP-mediated anti-cancerous effect 
was associated with the downregulation of PRL expression, further suppressing 
the JAK2/STAT5A/Cyclin D1 signaling pathway which has been validated using 
dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine. Cancer-related hyperprolactinemia confers 
cisplatin resistance, we observed that MP via PRL inhibition, enhances cisplatin 
efficacy after their combinatorial treatment in breast cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study suggests that MP could be recommended as 
dietary supplement along with the chemotherapeutic agents against breast cancer.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. The main modality to 
fight against cancer is surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, and more 
recently targeted therapy, gene therapy and immunotherapy, which play important 
roles in treating cancer patients. In the last decades, chemotherapy has been 
well developed. Nonetheless, administration of the drug is not always 
successful, as limited drug dosage can reach the tumor cells.. In this context, 
the possibility to use an encapsulated anti-cancer drug may potentially solve 
the problem. Liposomal cytarabine is a formulation with pronounced effectiveness 
in lymphomatous meningitis and reduced cardiotoxicity if compared to liposomal 
anthracyclines. Thus, the future liposomal cytarabine use could be extended to 
other diseases given its reduction in cytotoxic side effects compared to the 
free formulation. This review summarizes the chemistry and biology of liposomal 
cytarabine, with exploration of its clinical implications.

Herbal medicine has a long background equal to history of humankind. Several 
plants have been used as remedies in ancient Persian, Egyptian, Chinese and 
Indian civilizations. The plant Ocimum sanctum Linn. (Tulsi) is one of these 
medicinal plants with a wide variety of applications in traditional medicine. In 
modern era, it has been shown to be effective against diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, cancers, bronchitis, and found to have anti-microbial properties. 
Several experimental studies have confirmed its anti-inflammatory properties and 
its role in modulation of both cellular and humeral immunity. Recently its 
efficacy against inflammatory response, hepatic injury and gastric ulcer has 
been elucidated in animal studies. In liver, essential oils and extracts of 
Ocimum sanctum could prevent oxidative stress by increasing glutathione 
peroxidae and catalase and were also effective in prevention of hepatic 
steatosis. In gastric epithelial tissue different derivatives of Ocimum sanctum 
had anti-ulcer and anti-secretory characteristics and could heal gastric 
ulceration. These beneficial properties of this medicinal plant can mainly 
originate from its major biochemically active constituents like eugenol, 
carvacrol, ursolic acid, β-caryophyllene and rosmarinic acid. Here in, we 
reviewed current literature about anti-inflammatory, gastric and 
hepatoprotective properties of Ocimum sanctum.

OBJECTIVES: Selaginella bryopteris L. (family: Selaginaceae), is often used in 
traditional Indian systems of medicine for the prevention and cure of several 
disorders and for the treatment of patient with spermatorrhoea, venereal 
disease, constipation, colitis, urinary tract infections, fever, epilepsy, 
leucorrhoea, beri-beri and cancer. It is also used as a strength tonic. This 
study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects 
of topically administered aqueous, polar and non-polar methanolic fractions (10 
mg/20 μL) of Selaginella bryopteris.
METHODS: An acute oral toxicity study of Selaginella bryopteris at doses from 
250 to 2,000 mg/kg body weight (bw) was performed. Aqueous, polar and non-polar 
methanolic extracts (10 mg/20 μL) applied topically for 5 days were evaluated 
for their anti-inflammatory effects against 12-tetra-O-decanoyl phorbol acetate 
(TPA)-induced inflammation by using the redness in the ear, the ear's weight 
(edema), oxidative stress parameters, such as lipid-peroxide (LPO) and nitric 
oxide (NO), and the pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammation, such as 
tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6. Indomethacine (0.5 
mg/20 μL) was used for the positive control.
RESULTS: Selaginella bryopteris produced no mortalities when administered orally 
at doses from 250 to 2,000 mg/kg bw. Topical treatment with the non-polar 
methanolic fraction (10 mg/20 αL) significantly suppressed redness (2.4 ± 0.5) 
and edema (30.4 ± 1) and effectively reduced the LPO level (32.3 ± 3.3). The NO 
level was (8.07 ± 0.55), and the TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels were decreased to 
69.6 ± 15.5, 7.7 ± 4.8 and 82.6 ± 5.9, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated for the first time the mechanisms underlying 
the anti-inflammatory effect of medicinal plants like Selaginella bryopteris and 
quantified the pharmacological interactions between them. The present study 
showed this herbal product to be a promising anti-inflammatory phytomedicine for 
the treatment of patients with inflammatory skin diseases.

The present study was carried out to evaluate the anticancer, antioxidant, and 
possible anti-inflammatory properties of diverse medicinal plants frequently 
used in Indian traditional medication. The selected botanicals such as Soymida 
fembrifuga (Roxb.) A. Juss. (Miliaceae), Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers. 
(Menispermaceae), Lavandula bipinnata (L.) O. Ktze. (Lamiaceae), and Helicteres 
isora L. (Sterculiaceae) extracted in different solvents were evaluated for 
their in vitro anticancer and antioxidant activities. The results obtained 
indicate that H. isora has potent cytotoxic activity toward the selected cancer 
cells such as HeLa-B75 (34.21 ± 0.24%), HL-60 (30.25 ± 1.36%), HEP-3B (25.36 ± 
1.78%), and PN-15 (29.21 ± 0.52%). Interestingly, the selected botanicals 
selectively inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) more than (COX-1), which are the 
key enzymes implicated in inflammation. COX-2 inhibition was observed to be in 
the range of 19.66-49.52% as compared to COX-1 inhibition (3.93-19.61%). The 
results of the antioxidant study revealed that the selected plants were found to 
be effective 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl (OH), and superoxide 
radical (SOR) scavenging agents. High-performance thin layer chromatography 
(HPTLC) fingerprint of flavonoids was used as a measure of quality control of 
the selected plant samples. The results of the present findings strengthen the 
potential of the selected plants as a resource for the discovery of novel 
anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agents.

Withania somnifera is one of the most valued plants and is extensively used in 
Indian, Unani, and African systems of traditional medicine. It possess a wide 
array of therapeutic properties including anti-arthritic, anti-aging, 
anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, chemoprotective, 
cardioprotective, and recovery from neurodegenerative disorders. With the 
growing realization of benefits and associated challenges in the improvement of 
W. somnifera, studies on exploration of genetic and chemotypic variations, 
identification and characterization of important genes, and understanding the 
secondary metabolites production and their modulation has gained significant 
momentum. In recent years, several in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies have 
facilitated the validation of therapeutic potential of the phytochemicals 
derived from W. somnifera and have provided necessary impetus for gaining deeper 
insight into the mechanistic aspects involved in the mode of action of these 
important pharmaceutically active constituents. The present review highlights 
some of the current developments and future prospects of biotechnological 
intervention in this important medicinal plant.

Indian soil germinates thousands of medicinal drugs that are cultivated with a 
purpose to obtain a novel drug. As it is a well-established fact that the 
structural analogs with greater pharmacological activity and fewer side-effects 
may be generated by the molecular modification of the functional groups of such 
lead compounds. This review throws light on two natural triterpenes - Taraxerol 
and Taraxasterol which have many important pharmacological actions including 
anti-cancer activity, their chemistry, biosynthesis aspects, and possible use of 
these compounds as drugs in treatment of cancer. A silent crisis persists in 
cancer treatment in developing countries, and it is intensifying every year. 
Although at least 50-60% of cancer victims can benefit from radiotherapy that 
destroys cancerous tumors, but search for the paramount therapy which will prove 
to be inexpensive with minimal side effects still persists. Various treatment 
modalities have been prescribed, along with conventional and non-conventional 
medicine but due to their adverse effects and dissatisfaction among users, these 
treatments are not satisfactory enough to give relief to patients. Hence, this 
review sparks the occurrence of Taraxerol (VI) and Taraxasterol (VII) in nature, 
so that the natural godowns may be harvested to obtain these potent compounds 
for novel drug development as well as discusses limitations of these lead 
compounds progressing clinical trials.

Natural products are important sources of anti-cancer lead molecules. Many 
successful anti-cancer drugs are natural products or their analogues. Many more 
are under clinical trials. The present review focuses on chemopreventive and 
anti-cancer activities of polar and non-polar extracts, semi purified fractions 
and pure molecules from terrestrial plants of India reported between 2005 and 
2010 emphasizing possible mechanisms of action of pure molecules.

Development of drugs from plant sources (botanicals) for the treatment of cancer 
has not been successful in India, despite a plethora of medicinal plants and an 
equal number of experiments demonstrating anti-cancer activity of plant 
principles in vitro. There are several pitfalls in our approach to botanical 
drug development. Foremost is the lack of industry-academia collaborations in 
this field. Research goals in Indian academic institutions are generally 
short-term and mostly aimed at fulfilling the minimum requirements of a 
doctoral/MD or MPharm thesis. Secondly, quality assurance of herbal formulations 
is difficult to achieve and good manufacturing practices are expensive to 
implement. This could introduce bias during the biological evaluation of 
botanicals. A systematic approach covering a wide range of investigations 
including but not limited to mechanistic studies, potential herb-drug 
interactions, pharmacokinetics and bioavailability could help in the 
optimization of herbal formulations in the preclinical stage of development 
before they can be considered for clinical trials. Government initiatives such 
as Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathic have encouraged research in these 
areas, but are insufficient to promote focused and aggressive evaluation of 
potential herbs. Particular emphasis should be given to clinical 
pharmacokinetics, drug interactions and clinical trials in specific cancers for 
the evaluation of dosage, safety, efficacy and concomitant use with 
chemotherapy. Only such policies can result in meaningful evaluation of 
botanicals for cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Candidiasis is one of the most common opportunistic infections 
caused by Candida albicans. Fluconazole is the drug of choice for prevention and 
management of this condition. However, the emergence of fluconazole resistant 
candidal strains has become a major concern. Many herbs like fenugreek, 
cinnamon, papaya, oregano, garlic are rich in phytochemical constituents known 
to express antimycotic activity. With the available information, the present 
research study was carried out to assess the invitro anti-mycotic activity of 
hydro alcoholic extracts of Trigonella foenum-graecum seeds, Cinnamomum verum 
bark and Carica papaya leaves and seeds against fluconazole resistant Candida 
albicans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydro alcoholic extracts of Trigonella foenum-graecum 
(seeds), Cinnamomum verum (bark), Carica papaya CO.2 strain (male and female 
leaves) and Carica papaya CO.2 strain (seeds) were prepared by maceration. The 
anti-mycotic activity of the prepared extracts against Candida albicans was 
assessed by agar well diffusion method. Three independent experiments were 
performed in triplicates and the mean and standard deviation were calculated. 
Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined.
RESULTS: The results of the present study revealed that all the extracts 
exhibited anti-mycotic activity in a dose dependent manner and minimum 
inhibitory concentration of all the extracts was found to be 15.62 μg/ml.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study shed light on the fact that plant 
extracts could be used not only as an alternate drug for management of 
fluconazole resistant candidiasis but also explored further for oral cancer 
prevention as a therapeutic adjunct.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Butea monosperma belonging to family Fabaceae is 
used in the Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda) for various ailments 
including abdominal tumors and possess anti-estrogenic activity.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study is aimed at investigating the 
chemo-preventive potential of Butea monosperma in breast cancer and elucidating 
it's mechanism of action by assessing its effect on key processes like 
apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis.
METHODS: Cytotoxic potential of methanol extract of Butea monosperma flower 
(MEBM) was tested in MCF-7 (estrogen receptor positive), MDA-MB-231 (triple 
negative) and MDA-MB-453 (HER2 positive) human breast cancer cells by MTT assay. 
Chemo-preventive potential was evaluated in-vivo in Methylnitrosourea (MNU) 
induced mammary cancer in nulliparous Sprague-Dawley rats. The mechanism for 
anticancer potential was screened by in-vitro studies involving Annexin V- FITC 
assay (apoptosis), Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane assay (angiogenesis) and 
Migration assay (metastasis). Statistical analysis was done by one way and two 
way ANOVA (for Growth Rate and feed consumption efficiency) followed by post hoc 
Bonferroni's test with P value < 0.05.
RESULTS: It is observed that the exposure of MEBM, at various concentrations and 
time intervals to different cell lines, resulted in decreased cell 
proliferation. The IC50 value of MCF-7 cells was found significantly less than 
that of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells, which indicated that the extract of 
said medicinal plant were more potent inhibitors of estrogen positive breast 
cancer cells than other types of breast cancer cells in vitro. Corroborative 
evidences were acquired in MNU actuated mammary carcinogenesis where MEBM 
constricted tumor parameters, decreased expression of estrogen and progesterone, 
nucleic acid content and increased latency period. MEBM also induced apoptosis, 
inhibited angiogenesis and metastasis in-vitro.
CONCLUSION: Selective cytotoxic activity in MCF-7 estrogen positive breast 
cancer cells and inhibition of growth of mammary carcinoma in-vivo by methanol 
extract of Butea monosperma flowers (MEBM) suggests chemo-prevention through 
modulation of estrogen and progesterone receptor, apoptotic, anti-angiogenesis 
and anti-metastatic activity.

A series of novel chalcone-triazole derivatives were synthesized and screened 
for in vitro anticancer activity on the human cancer cell lines IMR32 
(neuroblastoma), HepG2 (hepatoma) and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), DU-145 
(prostate carcinoma), and A549 (lung adenocarcinoma). Among the tested 
compounds, 4r showed the most promising anticancer activity in all the cell 
lines whereas, compounds 4c (IC50 65.86 μM), 4e (IC50 66.28 μM), 4o (IC50 
35.81 μM), 4q (IC50 50.82 μM) and 4s (IC50 48.63 μM) showed better activity than 
the standard doxorubicin (IC50 69.33 μM) in A549 cell line alone. Rat intestinal 
α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the synthesized derivatives showed 4m (IC50 
67.77 μM), 4p (IC50 74.94 in μM) and 4s (IC50 102.10 μM) as most active compared 
to others. The in silico docking of synthesized derivatives 4a-4t with DNA 
topoisomerase IIα revealed the LibDock score in the range of 71.2623-118.29 
whereas, compounds 4h, 4m, 4p and 4s with docking target α-glucosidase were in 
the range of 100.372-107.784.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths throughout the world. 
Extracts of medicinal plants are believed to contain different chemopreventive 
or chemotherapeutic compounds. In this study, we determined the anti-cancer 
property of one of the traditional Indian medicine Rasagenthi Lehyam (RL) for 
the treatment of lung cancer. Two lung cancer cell lines (A-549 and H-460) and 
one normal bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cell line were used to test the 
chemotherapeutic effect of RL. Out of five fractions of RL, chloroform fraction 
of RL (cRL) demonstrated a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and 
induction of apoptosis in A-549 and H-460 cells but not in normal BEAS-2B cells. 
The cRL fraction up-regulated the pro-apoptotic genes p53 and Bax and induced 
caspase-3 activation, and down-regulated the pro-survival gene Bcl-2 in both the 
lung cancer cell lines. Also, nuclear export of p53 was seen in cRL-treated lung 
cancer cells. In addition, cRL induced G2/M arrest of cell cycle and enhanced 
the radio-sensitivity of both the lung cancer cell lines. This study suggests 
that cRL may prove to be a potent anti-cancer agent that may be used for the 
treatment of lung cancer. However, further studies are required to bring cRL 
into the mainstream of medicine in the treatment of lung cancer.

Plants have proved to be an important source of anti-cancer drugs. Wrightia 
arborea, an Indian Ayurvedic medicinal plant, is used traditionally to treat a 
variety of ailments. This study evaluates the antiproliferative/apoptotic 
potential of Wrightia arborea leaf extracts, prepared in different organic 
solvents, on cancer cell lines. MTT assay, light and fluorescence microscopy, 
flow cytometry, DNA laddering, alkaline comet assay, and western blotting were 
some of the techniques used for evaluation. Combinations of camptothecin, either 
with CHK1 inhibitor-PD407824 or with W. arborea leaf extract, were deployed to 
determine the G2 abrogating potential of the extract. The chloroform extract 
(WAC) selectively killed K562 cells, without affecting cancerous MCF-7, Hep G2 
cells, and normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Cell death was 
characterized by observation of apoptotic bodies, increased Ca2+ and ROS, 
phosphatidyl serine externalization, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, DNA 
laddering, increased sub-G1 population, and altered expression of caspase 3, -9, 
and PARP. WAC also induced DNA damage, alterations in key G2/M phase protein 
expression, cell cycle perturbation, and potent G2 abrogation. The present study 
showed that W. arborea leaf extract, WAC, is capable of selectively killing 
leukemic cancer cells leaving normal lymphocytes unaffected. Our results 
indicate that this is effectuated through DNA damage and G2 abrogation leading 
to mitochondrial apoptosis. Taken together, this report contributes toward a 
better understanding of the anticancer properties of this traditional medicinal 
plant extract possessing valuable bioactive constituents which can serve as a 
bioresource for promising complimentary/alternative/chemopreventive 
therapeutics.

The concept of Ayurvedic expert guided drug discovery and development is defined 
and put to test systematically for the first time in literature. Western Science 
has explored only ~5% of the approximately 25,000 species of higher plants for 
drug leads. The ancient medical science of Ayurveda has however employed a much 
larger spectrum of plants for clinical treatment. Clerodendrum viscosum (CV), a 
commonly growing weed in the Indian subcontinent has been employed by S. 
Nirmalananda (Ayurvedic expert) for the treatment of cervical cancer. Here we 
isolate and characterize a water extract fraction (Cv-AP) from the root of CV 
and evaluate its anticervical cancer cell bioactivity. Our results indicate that 
Cv-AP possesses pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, and anti-migratory activity 
in a dose-dependent fashion against cervical cancer cell lines. In contrast, 
primary fibroblasts (control healthy cells), when exposed to similar 
concentrations of this extract, fail to undergo apoptosis and remain relatively 
unaffected. These findings suggest that Clerodendrum viscosum (CV) is a readily 
available source of components with potent anti-cancer activity and selective 
bioactivity against cervical cancer cells. The major component in CV-AP was 
identified as a glycoprotein via SDS Page and Concanavalin-A binding studies. 
This study serves to illustrate that systematic collaboration with Ayurveda is a 
practical and powerful strategy in drug discovery and development.

Human calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) is a member of 
Ser/Thr kinase family, and is associated with different types of cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Vanillin is a natural compound, a primary component 
of the extract of the vanilla bean which possesses varieties of pharmacological 
features including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and 
anti-tumor. Here, we have investigated the binding mechanism and affinity of 
vanillin to the CAMKIV which is being considered as a potential drug target for 
cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We found that vanillin binds strongly to 
the active site cavity of CAMKIV and stabilized by a large number of 
non-covalent interactions. We explored the utility of vanillin as anti-cancer 
agent and found that it inhibits the proliferation of human hepatocyte carcinoma 
(HepG2) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells in a dose-dependent manner. 
Furthermore, vanillin treatment resulted into the significant reduction in the 
mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ROS production that eventually leads 
to apoptosis in HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cancer cells. These findings may offer a novel 
therapeutic approach by targeting the CAMKIV using natural product and its 
derivative with a minimal side effect.

Herbal medicine which involves the use of plants for their medicinal value, 
dates as far back as the origin of mankind and demonstrates an array of 
applications including cardiovascular protection and anti-cancer activities, via 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and metabolic activities. Even today the 
popularity of medicinal herbs is still growing like in traditional medicines 
such as the Indian medicine, Ayurveda. One of the Ayurvedic medicinal plants is 
Withania somnifera Dunal, of which the important constituents are the 
withanolides. Among them, Withaferin A is one of the most bioactive compounds, 
exerting anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic but also anti-invasive and 
anti-angiogenic effects. In the context of modern pharmacology, a better insight 
in the underlying mechanism of the broad range of bioactivities exerted by 
Withaferin A is compulsory. Therefore, a lot of effort was made to explore the 
intracellular effects of Withaferin A and to characterize its target proteins. 
This review provides a decisive insight on the molecular basis of the 
health-promoting potential of Withaferin A.

In the recent years, the interest and research in medicinal plants have 
increased in a great deal. Ayurvedic medicines and formulations developed from 
ancient Indian herbal systems are renowned for their various important 
applications. Berberis aristata - an Indian medicinal plant, which belongs to 
the family Berberidaceae is an ayurvedic herb used since ancient times. It is 
also known as Indian berberi, Daruharidra, Daruhaldi, Darvi and Chitra. The 
plant is useful as anti-pyretic, anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, 
anti-hepatotoxic, anti-hyperglycaemic, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and 
anti-lipidemic agent. B. aristata extracts and its formulations are also useful 
in the treatment of diarrhoea, haemorrhoids, gynaecological disorders, HIV-AIDS, 
osteoporosis, diabetes, eye and ear infections, wound healing, jaundice, skin 
diseases and malarial fever. This review aims to highlight the ethnobotany, 
pharmacognosy and pharmacological uses of B. aristata which will give insights 
in developing potentially new bioactives from the plant scaffolds. This review 
will also highlight the patenting trends, the new compositions developed using 
the actives from B. aristata and the different assignees involved in filing 
patents.

Plants have many medicinal properties including anticancer activity due to the 
presence of several secondary metabolites. Current cancer treatment policies are 
not much effective because of side effects and resistance development. 
Therefore, the discovery of new phytotherapeutics with no or fewer side effects 
is highly needed. Pterospermum acerifolium (L.) wild, an angiosperm has a broad 
application in traditional Indian medicinal system including cancer treatment. 
Despite, there is no study available on the cytotoxic and apoptotic effect of P. 
acerifolium in human cancer cells. Exploring the medicinal properties of P. 
acerifolium plant by its traditional use will be helpful towards developing 
novel cancer therapeutics. Hence, we decided to demonstrate the 
anti-carcinogenic property of P. acerifolium ethanolic bark extract against lung 
(A549) and pancreatic (PANC-1) cancer cells. The cytotoxicity was demonstrated 
by MTT assay, morphological changes, and scratch invasion assay. Flow cytometry, 
fluorescence staining techniques, and cell cycle analysis were confirmed the 
apoptotic property of P. acerifolium plant. The cell viability assay revealed 
that P. acerifolium ethanolic bark extract significantly reduced the viability 
of both A549 and PANC-1 cells. Moreover, PANC-1 cells showed more sensitivity 
towards P. acerifolium ethanolic bark extract than A549 at higher 
concentrations. Clear visualization of changes such as cytoplasmic condensation, 
cellular morphology, cell shrinkage, and augmented number of dead cells in both 
the cancer cells was observed after treatment. Scratch and invasion assay showed 
that cell migration and invasion rate of both the cancer cells were 
significantly reduced. Fluorescence microscopic studies using acridine 
orange/ethidium bromide and DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining 
showed early and late apoptotic symptoms after treatment with bark extract. 
Rhodamine-123 and DCFH-DA staining analysis by fluorescence and flow cytometry 
showed that bark extract depolarized the mitochondria membrane potential and 
induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Cell cycle analysis through 
flow cytometry using propidium iodide stain showed that P. acerifolium bark 
extract arrested A549 and PANC-1 cells in sub-G1 phase stated early apoptosis. 
These findings collectively point to the fact that P. acerifolium bark extract 
induced cell cytotoxicity in lung and pancreatic cancer cells by modulating 
mitochondrial-mediated ROS generation, and cell cycle checkpoints.

The medicinal properties of the most successful plant in the deserts of the 
western hemisphere, the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), are evidenced by the 
long traditional usage of the plants by the Native Americans Indian tribes in 
Southwestern North America and the Amerindians from South America. The plant is 
rich in simple bisphenyl lignans and tricyclic lignans known as cyclolignans. 
These compounds are responsible for many of the pharmacological activities of 
extracts of the plants. Some of these activities, namely antiherpes, 
antioxidant, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory, were known a century ago. Only 
recently have further studies revealed other crucial activities of the same 
plant molecules as powerful agents against human immunodeficiency virus, human 
papillomavirus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and symptoms of aging. 
Molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral and anticancer activities have 
been elucidated and involve the inhibition of SP1 dependent gene transcription. 
This review summarizes the recent findings on creosote bush lignans. We 
introduce the concept of a cocktail of safe well-characterized natural products 
from the creosote bush that would represent a bridge between oriental herbal 
medicines and Western drug-based therapies.

Cytotoxic, Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant Activities of Heliotropium indicum 
Extracts.

Chunthorng-Orn J, Dechayont B, Phuaklee P, Prajuabjinda O, Juckmeta T, Itharat 
A.

BACKGROUND: Heliotropium indicum Linn., or ‘Indian heliotrope’ is very common in 
India with a long history of traditional medicinal uses in many countries in the 
world. In Thailand, the plant has been traditionally use to cure various 
diseases such as fever, insect bites, stings, diarrhea, skin rashes, menstrual 
disorder and urticaria. In addition, the plant is commonly used by Thai folk 
doctors as a component in remedies for treatment of lung cancer.
OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated cytotoxicity against two types 
of lung cancer cell lines (A549 and NCI-H226), anti-inflammatory effect and 
antioxidant activity of Heliotropium indicum extracts.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The water and ethanolic extracts of Heliotropium indicum 
were tested. The cytotoxic activity against two types of human lung cancer cell 
lines (A549 and NCI-H226) was evaluated by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. The 
antiinflammatory effect was investigated on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated 
RAW 264.7 macrophages. LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production was determined 
by Griess reagent. The antioxidant activity was performed by 1, 
1-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method.
RESULTS: The ethanolic extract showed cytotoxic activity only against NCI-H226 
(IC50 = 51.90±2.35 μg/ml) whereas the water extract had no cytotoxic activity 
against both A549 and NCI-H226 (IC50 >100 μg/ml). For anti-inflammatory effect, 
the results revealed that the ethanolic extract exhibited the most potent 
inhibitory activity on nitric oxide production (IC50 = 24.17±2.12 μg/ml), 
followed by Indomethacin (positive control) with an IC50 value of 34.67±6.23 
μg/ml while water extract was apparently inactive (IC50 >100 μg/ml). For 
antioxidant activity, the ethanolic extract showed high antioxidant activity 
(EC50 = 28.91±4.26 μg/ml) but the water extract showed no antioxidant activity 
(EC50 >100 μg/ml).
CONCLUSION: These results can support using Heliotropium indicum Linn. for 
component in lung cancer remedy by Thai folk doctors. However, more studies are 
required.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Withanolides are naturally occurring chemical compounds. 
They are secondary metabolites produced via oxidation of steroids and 
structurally consist of a steroid-backbone bound to a lactone or its 
derivatives. They are known to protect plants against herbivores and have 
medicinal value including anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, adaptogenic and 
anti-oxidant effects. Withaferin A (Wi-A) and Withanone (Wi-N) are two 
structurally similar withanolides isolated from Withania somnifera, also known 
as Ashwagandha in Indian Ayurvedic medicine. Ashwagandha alcoholic leaf extract 
(i-Extract), rich in Wi-N, was shown to kill cancer cells selectively. 
Furthermore, the two closely related purified phytochemicals, Wi-A and Wi-N, 
showed differential activity in normal and cancer human cells in vitro and in 
vivo. We had earlier identified several genes involved in cytotoxicity of 
i-Extract in human cancer cells by loss-of-function assays using either siRNA or 
randomized ribozyme library.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we have employed 
bioinformatics tools on four genes, i.e., mortalin, p53, p21 and Nrf2, 
identified by loss-of-function screenings. We examined the docking efficacy of 
Wi-N and Wi-A to each of the four targets and found that the two closely related 
phytochemicals have differential binding properties to the selected cellular 
targets that can potentially instigate differential molecular effects. We 
validated these findings by undertaking parallel experiments on specific gene 
responses to either Wi-N or Wi-A in human normal and cancer cells. We 
demonstrate that Wi-A that binds strongly to the selected targets acts as a 
strong cytotoxic agent both for normal and cancer cells. Wi-N, on the other 
hand, has a weak binding to the targets; it showed milder cytotoxicity towards 
cancer cells and was safe for normal cells. The present molecular docking 
analyses and experimental evidence revealed important insights to the use of 
Wi-A and Wi-N for cancer treatment and development of new anti-cancer 
phytochemical cocktails.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: There are more than 3000 officially documented 
plants in the Indian subcontinent that hold great medicinal potential. One such 
under-explored plant is an evergreen tropical tree Neolamarckia cadamba (Roxb.) 
Bosser (Rubiaceae). It is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions 
of the world and has therapeutic potential against many diseases such as 
diabetes, anaemia, stomatitis, leprosy, cancer and infectious diseases. 
Neolamarckia cadamba has historical existence in India and it is mentioned in 
mythical stories. There are several reports on medicinal values of root, bark 
and leaves of N. cadamba; but the literature on its fruits is scanty. Therefore, 
the present review aims to provide updated comprehensive information on the 
phytochemistry and pharmacological properties of different parts of N. cadamba 
tree with special reference to its fruit, in order to open new perspectives for 
future food and pharmacological research.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed on N. cadamba using 
ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, 
unpublished materials, government survey reports and scientific databases such 
as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Google Scholar and other web 
search engines (Google, Yahoo). The Plant List, International Plant Name Index 
and Kew Botanical Garden Plant name databases were used to validate the 
scientific names.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Neolamarckia cadamba is one of the economically 
important trees, which is being exploited for paper, pulp and wood industry. In 
folk medicine, various parts of N. cadamba are used in the treatment of various 
ailments such as fever, uterine complaints, blood diseases, skin diseases, 
tumour, anaemia, eye inflammation and diarrhoea. Other reported uses of N. 
cadamba include antihepatotoxic, antimalarial, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, 
antipyretic, diuretic and laxative. Various phytochemicals such as cadambine and 
its derivatives (dihydrocadambine and isodihydrocadambine) and indole alkaloids 
(Neolamarckines) were isolated from the leaves; whereas the presence of quinovic 
acid derivatives have been reported in the bark of N. cadamba.
CONCLUSION: The present review compiles information on an ethnopharmacologically 
useful plant N. cadamba. Bioactive compounds responsible for its various 
medicinal properties and their effects at the molecular level need to be 
investigated in more detail. Furthermore, the detailed study of toxicity and 
pharmacological properties of extracts as well as molecules in N. cadamba is 
required to confirm the ethnomedicinal claims of N. cadamba for food and 
pharmaceutical applications.

It is estimated that 80% of the world population depends on traditional medicine 
for primary healthcare need. Trianthema portulacastrum Linn. (family: Aizoaceae) 
is a small perennial weed found in the Americas, Africa, India, and other 
regions of the world. This plant is used extensively in Indian traditional 
medicines and is also consumed as a vegetable throughout Asia for its perceived 
health benefits. Phytochemical analysis of T. portulacastrum reveals the 
presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, saponins, and phenolic compounds. 
Emerging studies demonstrate that crude extracts as well as bioactive 
phytoconstituents of T. portulacastrum exhibit potent antioxidant, 
anti-infective, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities. A growing number of 
in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate various biological and pharmacological 
activities, including prevention and amelioration of hepatotoxicity, 
nephrotoxicity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, infectious diseases and cancer. 
This review aims to present and analyze available literature to understand the 
full potential of T. portulacastrum in health promotion and disease prevention. 
Current limitations and future directions of research on this medicinal and 
dietary plant are also critically discussed.

Methanolic extract (75%) of Terminalia chebula, Terminalia belerica, Emblica 
officinalis and their combination named 'Triphala' (equal proportion of above 
three plant extracts) are being used extensively in Indian system of medicine. 
They were found to inhibit lipid peroxide formation and to scavenge hydroxyl and 
superoxide radicals in vitro. The concentration of plant extracts that inhibited 
50% of lipid peroxidation induced with Fe(2+)/ascorbate were food to be 85.5, 
27, 74 and 69 micro g/ml, respectively. The concentration needed for the 
inhibition of hydoxyl radical scavenging were 165, 71, 155.5 and 151 micro g/ml, 
and that for superoxide scavenging activity were found to be 20.5, 40.5, 6.5 and 
12.5 micro g/ml, respectively. Oral administration of the extracts (100 mg/kg 
body weight) reduced the blood sugar level in normal and in alloxan (120 mg/kg) 
diabetic rats significantly within 4 h. Continued, daily administration of the 
drug produced a sustained effect.

Viola odorata L. (Violaceae), an Indian medicinal plant, contains a plethora of 
cyclotides, which are a class of cyclic peptides derived from plants, possessing 
several applications. Somatic embryo culture of V. odorata was developed, via 
indirect somatic embryogenesis, to serve as an alternative to natural plant 
biomass for sustainable and continuous production of its bioactive ingredients, 
such as cyclotides. Among the various combinations of phytohormones tested, 
Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 1 mg/l thidiazuron gave rise to the 
maximum frequency of induction (86.7%) and a high number of somatic embryos (3) 
from an embryogenic callus. Identification and characterization of cyclotides in 
the somatic embryos were carried out using a Fourier transform mass spectrometer 
coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-FTMS). Among the cyclotides identified in 
the study, few were found to be exclusively present in the somatic embryo 
culture. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the cyclotides was higher in 
somatic embryo extract than in the natural plant extract. The biological 
activities (cytotoxic, haemolytic and antimicrobial) of the somatic embryos and 
the parent plant were compared. Unlike the natural plants, the somatic embryo 
extracts demonstrated specificity i.e. they were found to be potent against 
cancerous cells but not against non-cancerous cell line or red blood cells. In 
contrast to the plant extract, the somatic embryos extracts were found to be 
potent against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. These results suggest 
that somatic embryos of V. odorata (rich in cyclotides) can be used as an 
alternative to plant biomass for its therapeutic applications and germplasm 
conservation.

Cancer or uncontrolled cell proliferation is a major health issue worldwide and 
is the second leading cause of deaths globally. The high mortality rate and 
toxicity associated with cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy have 
encouraged the investigation of complementary and alternative treatment methods, 
such as plant-based drugs. Moreover, over 60% of the anti-cancer drugs are 
molecules derived from plants or their synthetic derivatives. Therefore, in the 
present review, an attempt has been made to summarize the cytotoxic plants 
available in the Indian subcontinent along with a description of their 
bio-active components. The review covers 99 plants of 57 families as well as 
over 110 isolated bioactive cytotoxic compounds, amongst which at least 20 are 
new compounds. Among the reported phytoconstituents, artemisinin, lupeol, 
curcumin, and quercetin are under clinical trials, while brazilin, catechin, 
ursolic acid, β-sitosterol, and myricetin are under pharmacokinetic development. 
However, for the remaining compounds, there is little or no information 
available. Therefore, further investigations are warranted on these subcontinent 
medicinal plants as an important source of novel cytotoxic agents.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Antiplasmodial activity, inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) 
overproduction, and anti-proliferative activity were investigated in vitro to 
evaluate the bioactive potential of the traditional pharmacopoeia of the 
Mascarene Archipelago, which is known for its biodiversity and for the richness 
of its endemic flora.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 45 methanol (MeOH) and dichloromethane (DCM) 
extracts were prepared from 19 plant species collected on Réunion and Mauritius 
Islands. Ninety-six-well microplate assays were performed on chloroquine 
sensitive Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain, on LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 murine 
macrophages and on A-549, DLD-1 and WS1 human cells. Activity was evaluated 
through spectrophotometric methods.
RESULTS: Activity was attributed to plant extracts expressing IC(50)<50μg/ml for 
antiplasmodial response, IC(50)<100μg/ml for cytotoxicity, and IC(50)<130μg/ml 
for anti-inflammatory reaction. The majority of the extracts tested (69%) 
exhibited potency in at least one of these three types of activity. This is the 
first report describing promising antiplasmodial activity (IC(50)<15μg/ml) for 
Psiadia dentata DCM extract and Terminalia bentzoe MeOH bark extract. NO 
inhibition assay revealed seven interesting plants, described for the first time 
as anti-inflammatory: Aphloia theiformis, Buddleja salviifolia, Eupatorium 
riparium, Hiptage benghalensis, Psiadia arguta, Psiadia dentata, and Scutia 
commersonii. Finally, anti-proliferative activity was observed for two endemic 
species, Geniostoma borbonicum and Nuxia verticillata.
CONCLUSION: Using the criterion of endemism as part of the criteria for 
traditional medicinal use raises the chances of finding original active 
principles. In our case, 86% of the endemic plants tested displayed 
pharmacological interest.

Nature is a rich source of natural drug-like compounds with minimal side 
effects. Phytochemicals better known as "Natural Products" are found abundantly 
in a number of plants. Since time immemorial, spices have been widely used in 
Indian cuisine as flavoring and coloring agents. Most of these spices and 
condiments are derived from various biodiversity hotspots in India (which 
contribute 75% of global spice production) and form the crux of India's 
multidiverse and multicultural cuisine. Apart from their aroma, flavor and 
taste, these spices and condiments are known to possess several medicinal 
properties also. Most of these spices are mentioned in the Ayurveda, the 
indigenous system of medicine. The antimicrobial, antioxidant, 
antiproliferative, antihypertensive and antidiabetic properties of several of 
these natural products are well documented in Ayurveda. These phytoconstituemts 
are known to act as functional immunoboosters, immunomodulators as well as 
anti-inflammatory agents. As anticancer agents, their mechanistic action 
involves cancer cell death via induction of apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. 
The present review provides a comprehensive and collective update on the 
potential of 66 commonly used spices as well as their bioactive constituents as 
anticancer agents. The review also provides an in-depth update of all major in 
vitro, in vivo, clinical and pharmacological studies done on these spices with 
special emphasis on the potential of these spices and their bioactive 
constituents as potential functional foods for prevention, treatment and 
management of cancer.

This review, containing over 276 references, covers the progress made in the 
chemistry and bioactivity of this important group of triterpenoids. Though 
initially known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activities 
through a unique 5-LO inhibition mechanism, boswellic acids have recently 
attained significance due to their anti-cancer properties. The phytochemistry 
and chemical modifications, including mechanism of action, are discussed.

The medicinal plant Withania somnifera is widely researched for its 
anti-inflammatory, cardioactive and central nervous system effects. In Ayurveda 
, the major Traditional Indian medicine system, extracts from W. somnifera are 
distinctively employed for the treatment of arthritis and menstrual disorders. 
Because these conditions involve angiogenic processes we hypothesized that the 
W. somnifera extracts might contain angiogenesis inhibitors. We employed an 
endothelial cell-sprouting assay to monitor the purification of substances from 
W. somnifera root extracts and isolated as the active principle the previously 
known natural product withaferin A. We show that withaferin A inhibits human 
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) sprouting in three-dimensional 
collagen-I matrix at doses which are relevant to NF-kappa B-inhibitory activity. 
Withaferin A inhibits cell proliferation in HUVECs (IC50 =12 nM) at doses that 
are significantly lower than those required for tumor cell lines through a 
process associated with inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. We propose that the 
inhibition of NF-kappa B by withaferin A in HUVECs occurs by interference with 
the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway as suggested by the increased levels 
of poly-ubiquitinated proteins. Finally, withaferin A is shown to exert potent 
anti-angiogenic activity in vivo at doses that are 500-fold lower than those 
previously reported to exert anti-tumor activity in vivo. In conclusion, our 
findings identify a novel mode of action of withaferin A, which highlights the 
potential use of this natural product for cancer treatment or prevention.

To explore in vitro anticancer potential of Aerva lanata L. (flowering aerial 
part). The study was performed with 5 different human cell lines for the study 
of lung, leukaemia, prostate, colon and cervix cancer by using Sulphorhodamine B 
(SRB) assay. There were three doses of 10, 30 and 100 microg mL(-1) of each 
Aerva lanata L. Chloroform fraction (ALCF) and Aerva lanata L. Ethyl Acetate 
Fraction (ALEAF) used in this study. ALCF showed significant % inhibitory effect 
for leukaemia, lung and colon cancer at maximum concentration of 100 microg 
mL(-1) as compared to standard drug mitomycin. On the other hand ALEAF showed 
the significant % inhibitory effect for lung and cervix cancer at maximum 
concentration of 100 microg mL(-1) as compared to standard drug 5-fluoro Uracil 
(5-FU). From the above studies it is concluded that, the ethyl acetate fraction 
and chloroform fraction of Aerva lanata L. provide enough experimental evidence 
for anticancer activity and these fractions could be useful in medical care.

BACKGROUND: Medicinal plants have played an important role in the development of 
clinically useful anticancer agents. Elephantopus scaber (Asteraceae) (ES) is 
widely used in Indian traditional system of medicine for the treatment of 
various ailments including cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate anticancer effects of ES in human epithelial cancer 
cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity of ethanolic extract of ES (ES-ET) and its 
fractions, such as ES Petroleum ether fraction (ES-PET), ES Dichloromethane 
fraction (ES DCM), n Butyl alcohol fraction (ES-BT), and ES-Rest (ES-R) were 
assessed in human epithelial cancer cell lines using sulforhodamine B (SRB) 
assay. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide assay and Hoechst 33342 assays were used 
to gauge induction of apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis and micronuclei assay were 
used to assess cell cycle specific pharmacological effects and drug induced 
genotoxicty. Further, the ability of ES to inhibit multi drug resistant (MDR) 
transporters (ABC-B1 and ABC-G2) was determined by Rhodamine (Rho) and 
Mitoxantrone (MXR) efflux assays.
RESULTS: The enriched fraction of ES (ES DCM) possessed dose-dependent potent 
cytotoxicity in human epithelial cancer cells. Further, treatment of cancer 
cells (HeLa, A549, MCF-7, and Caco-2) with ES DCM showed hall mark properties of 
apoptosis (membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation etc.). Similarly, ES DCM 
caused enhanced sub G0 content and micronuclei formation indicating the 
induction of apoptosis and drug induced genotoxicity in cancer cells, 
respectively. Interestingly, ES DCM inhibited MDR transporters (ABC B1 and ABC 
G2) in cancer cells.
CONCLUSION: The enriched fraction of ES imparted cytotoxic effects, triggered 
apoptosis, induced genotoxicity, and inhibited MDR transporters in human 
epithelial cancer cells. Thus, ES appears to be potential anticancer agent.

Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) is one of the most versatile medicinal plants, 
widely distributed in the Indian subcontinent. Neem is a rich source of 
limonoids that are endowed with potent medicinal properties predominantly 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. Azadirachtin, 
gedunin, and nimbolide are more extensively investigated relative to other neem 
limonoids. Accumulating evidence indicates that the anticancer effects of neem 
limonoids are mediated through the inhibition of hallmark capabilities of cancer 
such as cell proliferation, apoptosis evasion, inflammation, invasion, and 
angiogenesis. The neem limonoids have been demonstrated to target oncogenic 
signaling kinases and transcription factors chiefly, NF-κB, Wnt/β-catenin, 
PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Neem limonoids that target 
multiple pathways that are aberrant in cancer are ideal candidates for cancer 
chemoprevention and therapy.

Seventeen endophytic fungi were isolated from various tissues of Cassia fistula 
and the ethyl acetate extracts obtained from 21-day cultures of all the 
endophytic fungal isolates were initially screened for their cytotoxicity 
against HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells using MTT assay. Of these, 
Penicillium sclerotiorum extract (PSE), significantly affected the viability of 
HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner. The extract of P. Sclerotiorum was 
further analyzed by GC-MS, which showed three compounds, hexadecanoic acid, 
oleic acid and benzoic acid to be the major active principles in the 
extracts.The extract was further tested for invitro cytotoxicity against five 
cancer cell lines. Of the cell lines tested, HeLa cells showed maximum 
sensitivity followed by A549, while A431 and U251 were moderately sensitive and 
MCF-7 was insensitive to the treatment. In addition, normal human embryonic 
kidney cells, HEK293 remained insensitive to the treatment. Furthermore, the 
mechanism of cytotoxic activity exhibited by PSE was investigated by evaluating 
cell cycle progression and apoptotic induction in HeLa cells. Cell cycle 
analysis revealed that the PSE arrested cells at S and G2/M phase of the cell 
cycle in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin V- Propidium iodide double staining 
showed that, the extract potentiates apoptosis rather than necrosis in cells. 
This was supported by the down regulation in the proapoptotic protein BCL2 and 
up regulation of BAX (BCL2 Associated X), tumor suppressor protein, p53 and 
Apaf-1 [Apoptotic Peptidase Activating Factor 1]. Loss of mitochondrial membrane 
potential and a distinct DNA fragmentation pattern observed following the 
treatment, suggest that the PSE treatment leads to activation of mitochondrial 
pathway of apoptosis. Further, the extract also exhibited both antioxidant and 
anti-angiogenic properties. These results indicate that endophytic fungi 
isolated from medicinal plants may serve as potential sources of the 
anti-cancerous compounds.

Aqueous, organic and alcoholic extracts of over 100 samples of 60 species of 
Kallawaya medicinal herbs representing 30 plant families were assayed to compare 
their toxicity and ability to protect MT-2 T-lymphoblastoid cells from the 
cytopathic effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The results are 
reported as a therapeutic index (TI) which was > 25 for eighteen species, 
including seven > 50 and one > 100. The anti-HIV activity resided primarily in 
the aqueous rather than in the organic extracts and was concentrated in plants 
used in ethnomedicine to treat lung and liver diseases.

PIP: Plants are a rich source of anti-viral substances. The National Cancer 
Institute therefore annually screens about 1500 species from Africa, Southeast 
Asia, and South and Central America, but not Bolivia, for anti-HIV activity. 
Several unique compounds with anti-HIV activity have emerged from the program. 
The Kallawaya Indians of Bolivia follow a medical tradition from the Tiahuanaco 
(400-1145), Mollo (1145-1435), Inca (1438-1532), Spanish (1532-1825), and 
Bolivian Republic (from 1825) which is only recently starting to be reported. 
They use approximately 900 of the more than 2000 medicinal plants found across 
Bolivia. Aqueous, organic, and alcoholic extracts of more than 100 samples of 60 
species of Kallawaya medicinal herbs representing 30 plant families were assayed 
to compare their toxicity and ability to protect MT-2 T-lymphoblastoid cells 
from the cytopathic effects of HIV. The therapeutic index (TI) of sampled 
species is defined as the ratio of anti-HIV activity to toxic concentration. A 
TI of greater than 25 was chosen as the prerequisite for future 
bioassay-directed isolation of the active components as leads for potential new 
anti-HIV drugs. TI was greater than 25 for 18 species, including seven greater 
than 50 and one greater than 100. The anti-HIV activity resided mainly in the 
aqueous extracts and was concentrated in plants used in ethnomedicine to treat 
lung and liver diseases.

Beyond reverse pharmacology: Mechanism-based screening of Ayurvedic drugs.

This paper reviews the pharmacology of Indian medicinal plants, starting with 
the historical background of European work on the subject beginning as early as 
the 17th century, and tracing its history through the work of Sen and Bose in 
the 1930's, and Vakhil's historic 1949 paper on Sarpaghanda. The often crucial 
role of patient feedback in early discoveries is highlighted, as is the time lag 
between proof of pharmacological action and identification of the active 
principle, and subsequent elucidation of mechanism of action. In the case of 
Indian plants in the 20th century this process sometimes took almost 50 years. 
Reserpine and its mechanisms are given in detail, and its current relevance to 
public health discussed. The foundation of present day methods of pharmacology 
is briefly presented so the complexity of methods used to identify properties of 
Ayurveda derived drugs like forskolin and baicalein, and their bioavailability, 
may be better appreciated. Ayurveda derived anti-oxidants and their levels of 
action, immuno-modulators, particularly with respect to the NF-kB pathway and 
its implications for cancer control, are all considered. The example of curcumin 
derived from turmeric is explained in more detail, because of its role in cancer 
prevention. Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of Ayurveda's concepts 
of rasayana as a form of dietary chemo-prevention; the significance of ahar, 
diet, in Ayurveda's aspiration to prevent disease and restore health thus 
becomes clear. Understood in this light, Ayurveda may transcend pharmacology as 
a treatment paradigm.

Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi), an Indian medicinal plant, was used to explore 
antitumor promoting activity in a two-stage skin carcinogenesis model. For this 
purpose, mice were treated by single application of DMBA (100 microg/100 microl 
of acetone) and two weeks later promoted by croton oil (1% in acetone three 
times a week) until the end of the experiment (i.e., 16 weeks). Oral 
administration of the above extract at the preinitiational stage (i.e., seven 
days before and seven days after DMBA application; group IV), promotional stage 
(i.e., from the time of croton oil application; group V), and both pre- and 
postintiational stage (i.e., from the time of DMBA application and continued 
until the end of the experiment; group VI; on the shaven backs of the mice at 
the dose of 100 mg/kg body weight/day for 16 weeks) recorded significant 
reduction in tumor weight, tumor incidence in comparison to control (i.e., mice 
treated with DMBA and croton oil; group III). Furthermore, cumulative number of 
papillomas, tumor yield, tumor burden, and tumor weight showed significant 
reduction along with significant elevation of phase II detoxifying enzymes, and 
inhibition of lipid peroxidation in liver and skin in the animals administered 
with such plant extract concomitant to carcinogen exposure. Thus, the present 
data strongly suggests that the Tinospora cordifolia extract has anti-tumor 
potential in a two-stage skin carcinogenesis mouse model.

The present study was designed to evaluate in vitro anti-proliferative potential 
of extracts from four Indian medicinal plants, namely Anogeissus latifolia, 
Terminalia bellerica, Acacia catechu and Moringa oleiferna. Their cytotoxicity 
was tested in nine human cancer cell lines, including cancers of lung (A549), 
prostate (PC-3), breast (T47D and MCF-7), colon (HCT-16 and Colo-205) and 
leukemia (THP-1, HL-60 and K562) by using SRB and MTT assays. The findings 
showed that the selected plant extracts inhibited the cell proliferation of nine 
human cancer cell lines in a concentration dependent manner. The extracts 
inhibited cell viability of leukemia HL-60 and K562 cells by blocking G0/G1 
phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, A. catechu extract at 100 μg/mL induced 
G2/M arrest in K562 cells. DNA fragmentation analysis displayed the appearance 
of a smear pattern of cell necrosis upon agarose gel electrophoresis after 
incubation of HL-60 cells with these extracts for 24 h.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major worldwide health problem, causing 
chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and primary liver cancer (Hepatocellular 
carcinoma). HCV encodes a precursor polyprotein that is enzymatically cleaved to 
release the individual viral proteins. The viral non-structural proteins are 
cleaved by the HCV NS3 serine protease. NS3 is regarded currently as a potential 
target for anti-viral drugs thus specific inhibitors of its enzymatic activity 
should be of importance. A prime requisite for detailed biochemical studies of 
the protease and its potential inhibitors is the availability of a rapid 
reliable in vitro assay of enzyme activity. A novel assay for measurement of HCV 
NS3 serine protease activity was developed for screening of HCV NS3 serine 
protease potential inhibitors. Recombinant NS3 serine protease was isolated and 
purified, and a fluorometric assay for NS3 proteolytic activity was developed. 
As an NS3 substrate we engineered a recombinant fusion protein where a green 
fluorescent protein is linked to a cellulose-binding domain via the NS5A/B site 
that is cleavable by NS3. Cleavage of this substrate by NS3 results in emission 
of fluorescent light that is easily detected and quantitated by fluorometry. 
Using our system we identified NS3 serine protease inhibitors from extracts 
obtained from natural Indian Siddha medicinal plants. Our unique fluorometric 
assay is very sensitive and has a high throughput capacity making it suitable 
for screening of potential NS3 serine protease inhibitors.

acid, a plant phenolic acid. It exhibited potent cytotoxicities 
(IC50=0.010-14.76μM) against various human carcinoma cells. In cell cycle 
analysis, benzylidene indanone 1 induced G2/M phase arrest in both MCF-7 and 
MDA-MB-231 cells. It also induced apoptosis in DU145 cells which was evident by 
cleavage of PARP. In Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, benzylidene indanone 1 showed 
45.48% inhibition of tumour growth at 20mg/kg dose in Swiss albino mice. 
Further, in sub-acute toxicity experiment in Swiss-albino mice, it was found to 
be non-toxic up to 100mg/kg dose for 28days. The lead compound benzylidene 
indanone 1 can further be optimized for better anti-cancer activity.

Diallyl sulfide (C6H10S, DAS) is one of the novel natural organosulfur 
compounds, which is mostly obtained from the genus Allium plants. Numerous 
studies have revealed several unique properties of DAS in terms of its 
health-promoting effects. DAS has proved to be anticancer, antimicrobial, 
anti-angiogenic, and immunomodulatory like unique functions as demonstrated by 
the multiple investigations. Diallyl sulfide can also impede oxidative stress 
and chronic inflammation as suggested by the literature. Studies also explored 
that DAS could thwart the development of chronic diseases like cancer, neuronal, 
cardiovascular disease through modulating mechanistic pathways involved in 
pathogenesis. In this book chapter, we have attempted to give the comprehensive 
view on DAS about the physiochemical and biological properties, and its 
preventive role in chronic diseases with a mechanistic overview.

The rising incidence of skin cancer in humans makes it equivalent to 
malignancies of organs. Therefore, it is necessary to intensify our efforts for 
better understanding and development of novel treatment and preventive 
approaches for skin cancer. Fruits and other plant derived products have gained 
considerable attention as they can reduce the risk of several cancer types. 
Lupeol, a triterpene, present in many fruits and medicinal plants, has been 
shown to possess many pharmacological properties including anti-cancer effect in 
both in vitro and in vivo assay systems. In the present study, apoptosis 
inducing effects of lupeol were studied in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 
cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that lupeol treatment induces apoptosis 
(14-37%) in a dose-dependent manner as evident by an increased sub G(1) cell 
population. The RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that lupeol-induced 
apoptosis was associated with caspase dependent mitochondrial cell death pathway 
through activation of Bax, caspases, Apaf1, decrease in Bcl-2 expression and 
subsequent cleavage of PARP. Lupeol treatment also inhibited Akt/PKB signaling 
pathway by inhibition of Bad (Ser136) phosphorylation and 14-3-3 expression. In 
addition, lupeol treatment inhibited cell survival by inactivation of NFkappaB 
through upregulation of its inhibitor Ikappabetaalpha. The Caspase mediated 
apoptosis was noticed by decrease in lupeol induced apoptosis by Caspase 
inhibitors as well as increase in reactive oxygen species generation and loss of 
mitochondrial membrane potential. These results suggest that lupeol could be an 
effective anti-cancer agent and merits further investigation.

Prevention of cancer through nutritional intervention has gained significant 
recognition in recent years. Evidence revealed from mechanistic investigations 
coupled with molecular epidemiology show an inverse association of dietary 
flavonoids intake with cancer risk. The chemopreventive and anticarcinogenic 
potential of Selaginella bryopteris, a traditional Indian herb referred to as 
'Sanjeevani' in the Ayurvedic system of medicine, was examined in the present 
study. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted on the 
flavonoid-rich benzene fraction of the aqueous extract that demonstrated a 
significant cytoprotective activity. Biomarkers of chemoprevention such as 
proliferative index and status of cell-cycle regulatory proteins, antioxidant 
property, anti-inflammatory effect, reversal of stress-induced senescence and 
genoprotective effect were investigated in human and murine cell cultures. 
Chemopreventive potential was assessed in benzopyrene-induced lung 
carcinogenesis and 7,12-dimethyl benz(a)anthracene-mediated skin 
papillomagenesis test models. Inhibition of DNA fragmentation, unperturbed 
cell-cycle regulation, maintenance of intracellular antioxidant defence, 
anti-inflammatory activity, prevention of stress-induced senescence and 
genoprotective effects against methyl isocyanate carcinogenicity was observed. 
Medium-term anticarcinogenicity and two-stage skin papillomagenesis tests 
strongly substantiated our in vitro observations. Results from the present study 
provide evidence of anticarcinogenic and chemopreventive activities of S. 
bryopteris hitherto unreported and reaffirm the nutritional significance of 
flavonoids in cancer prevention.

BACKGROUND: Cancer and HIV/AIDS are two of the greatest public health and 
humanitarian challenges facing the world today. Infection with HIV not only 
weakens the immune system leading to AIDS and increasing the risk of 
opportunistic infections, but also increases the risk of several types of 
cancer. The enormous biodiversity of marine habitats is mirrored by the 
molecular diversity of secondary metabolites found in marine animals, plants and 
microbes which is why this work was designed to assess the anti-HIV and 
cytotoxic activities of some marine organisms of the Red Sea.
METHODS: The lipophilic fractions of methanolic extracts of thirteen marine 
organisms collected from the Red Sea (Egypt) were screened for cytotoxicity 
against two human cancer cell lines; leukaemia (U937) and cervical cancer (HeLa) 
cells. African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) were used as normal 
non-malignant control cells. The extracts were also tested for their inhibitory 
activity against HIV-1 enzymes, reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR).
RESULTS: Cytotoxicity results showed strong activity of the Cnidarian Litophyton 
arboreum against U-937 (IC50; 6.5 μg/ml ±2.3) with a selectivity index (SI) of 
6.45, while the Cnidarian Sarcophyton trochliophorum showed strong activity 
against HeLa cells (IC50; 5.2 μg/ml ±1.2) with an SI of 2.09. Other species 
showed moderate to weak cytotoxicity against both cell lines. Two extracts 
showed potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 protease; these were the 
Cnidarian jelly fish Cassiopia andromeda (IC50; 0.84 μg/ml ±0.05) and the red 
algae Galaxura filamentosa (2.6 μg/ml ±1.29). It is interesting to note that the 
most active extracts against HIV-1 PR, C. andromeda and G. filamentosa showed no 
cytotoxicity in the three cell lines at the highest concentration tested 
(100 μg/ml).
CONCLUSION: The strong cytotoxicity of the soft corals L. arboreum and S. 
trochliophorum as well as the anti-PR activity of the jelly fish C. andromeda 
and the red algae G. filamentosa suggests the medicinal potential of crude 
extracts of these marine organisms.

Medicinal plants proved to be a rich source in exploring a variety of lead 
structures in the development of new drugs. The natural curcuminoids have gained 
considerable attention in recent years for their multiple beneficial 
pharmacological and biological activities. Clinical application of these 
curcuminoids is often impaired due to their poor water solubility, resulting in 
low in vivo bioavailability of the active compound in humans. The objective of 
the present study is to synthesize glucosyl conjugates of curcumin 1 and 
tetrahydrocurcumin 4 and to evaluate their biological activities. The study 
highlights the synthesis of curcumin-β-di-glucoside 3 (yield 71%) and 
tetrahydrocurcumin-β-di-glucoside 6 (yield 64%) in good yields in a biphasic 
reaction medium using a phase transfer catalyst under simple and ecofriendly 
conditions. Both the glucosyl curcuminoids showed enhanced antioxidant, 
tyrosinase enzyme inhibitory, antimicrobial and potent cytotoxic activity. The 
improved biological activity may be due to the increased solubility of the 
glucosyl conjugated compounds compared to the native curcuminoids; this was 
further confirmed by partition coefficient studies. Thus, the synthesized 
glucosyl curcumin may serve as promising future therapeutic molecule in the 
management of cancer, whereas glucosyl tetrahydrocurcumin can be a useful 
ingredient in achromatic food and in cosmetic applications.

A series of eleven novel bisindole derivatives were synthesized and screened for 
anticancer and antiobesity potentials in in vitro mode. The reaction of 1-ethoxy 
carbonyl 4-pyperidone 1a with indole-3-carboxaldehyde 1b in presence of 
catalytic amount of piperidine gave 2 which was N-alkylated with different 
benzyl halides in the presence of potassium carbonate to afford compounds 3a-3k 
in quantitative yields. Among the compounds tested for anticancer activity 
against different human cancer cell lines, 3f significantly inhibited HepG2 cell 
line (IC50 7.33 μM) when compared with standard doxorubicin (IC50 10.15 μM). 
Compounds 3e (IC50 2.75 μM), 3f (IC50 4.21 μM) and 3i (IC50 15.98 μM) showed 
better activity than the standard curcumin (IC50 23.54 μM) against A549 cell 
line. Also, among the synthesized compounds, 3g (IC50 14.89 μM), 3c (IC50 56.41 
μM) and 3i (IC50 30.88 μM) have potentially inhibited enzyme lipase when 
compared to standard Orlistat (IC50 62.25 μM). In in silico docking assays, 
piperidones 3e, 3f, 3i, 3c and 3a showed higher binding affinity towards 
anti-cancer target of A549 (3e: -11.1, 3f: -10.3, 3c: -11.3, 3i: -11.2 
kcal/mol), HepG2 (3f: -10.5 kcal/mol), HeLa (3d: -10.0 kcal/mol) and SKOV3 (3f: 
-8.4 kcal/mol) cell lines better than standard drug doxorubicin. Docking to 
lipase protein for compounds 3i, 3g and 3c showed scores of -11.1, -10.7 and 
-10.5 kcal/mol when compared to that of standard drug Orlistat with -6.9 
kcal/mol.

Angiogenesis is critical in both physiological and pathological conditions and 
targeting angiogenesis is a promising strategy for the development of therapies 
against cancer; however, cells develop resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy, 
necessitating a more effective strategy. Natural medicines have been used in 
anti-cancer therapy for many years, but the mechanisms behind these have not 
generally been explored. Triphala churna (THL), an Indian ayurvedic herbal 
formulation made from the dried fruits of three medicinal plants, is used as a 
herbal drug for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. THL 
contains over fifteen phytochemicals with different pharmacological effects, 
especially inhibition of tumor progression. In this study, we examined the 
effect of these compounds against different targets using docking and in vitro 
studies. Results showed that THL has a prediction efficacy of (-436.7), and it 
inhibited angiogenesis by blocking multiple components of the VEGF/VEGFR2 
signaling pathway. The anti-angiogenic effect was mediated by the combined 
effect of the two top ranked phytochemicals, punicalagin (-424.8) and chebulagic 
acid (-414.8). The new approach developed in this study to determine the 
potential efficacy of herbal formulation could be a useful strategy to assess 
the efficacy of different herbal formulations.

CONTEXT: Plants harbor endophytes with potential bioactivity. Markhamia 
tomentosa (Benth) K. Schum ex. Engl. (Bignoniaceae) is reported to possess 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities.
OBJECTIVE: The antifungal and antiproliferative properties of endophytic fungi 
extracts and fractions from M. tomentosa were evaluated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves of M. 
tomentosa and identified by ITS-rDNA sequence analysis. The antagonistic effect 
of the fungal strains was investigated against pathogenic fungi viz, Fusarium 
oxysporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorium, Rhizoctonia solani, and Botrytis cinerea 
using the dual culture assay for 5-7 days. Antiproliferative effect of the 
fungal extracts and fractions (3.91-250 μg/mL) on HeLa cancer cell line was 
tested and IC50 was calculated. Poisoning food assay and antifeedant activity 
against the pathogenic fungi and Spodoptera litura larvae, for 7 days and 2 h, 
respectively, was also tested at concentrations of 250, 500 and 1000 μg/mL.
RESULTS: Fungal endophytes Trichoderma longibrachiatum and Syncephalastrum 
racemosum were isolated from the leaves of M. tomentosa. Isolated endophytic 
fungal strains and solvent extracts showed MIC value of 1000 μg/mL against 
tested pathogenic fungi in the dual culture and poisoning food assays. Methanol 
fraction of S. racemosum isolate showed the most effective antiproliferative 
activity with IC50 of 43.56 μg/mL. Minimal feeding deterrent activity against S. 
litura larvae was also observed.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These findings showed that the leaves of Markhamia 
tomentosa harbor strains of endophytic fungi with promising health benefits, and 
suggest their antifungal and antiproliferative effects against pathogenic fungi 
and HeLa cancer cell line.

The present study portrays the isolation of four phenylpropanoids - ferulic acid 
(FA), sinapic acid (SA), caffeic acid (CA), and chlorogenic acid (CHA) from the 
water extract of Suaeda maritima (L.) Dumort, a phytochemically less explored 
Indian medicinal plant. Further, synthesis and characterization of silver and 
gold nanoparticles using the isolated phenylpropanoids were done. The silver 
nanoparticles synthesized from S. maritima water extract along with silver 
nano-conjugated forms of the isolated compounds exhibited appreciable 
anti-leukemic activity against K562 cells (human myeloid leukemia). Especially, 
the ferulic and CA-conjugated silver nanoparticles showed significant (P < .01) 
activity against leukemia.

BACKGROUND: Free radical-induced oxidative stress is the root cause for many 
human diseases. Naturally occurring antioxidant supplements from plants are 
vital to counter the oxidative damage in cells. The main objective of the 
present study was to characterize the antioxidant and antiproliferative 
potential of rice bran extracted from an important Indian rice variety, Njavara 
and to compare the same with two commercially available basmati rice varieties: 
Vasumathi, Yamini and a non medicinal variety, Jyothi.
METHODS: Methanolic extracts of rice bran from four varieties; Vasumathi, 
Yamini, Jyothi and Njavara were used to study their total phenolic and flavonoid 
contents, in vitro antioxidant activities including total antioxidant activity, 
scavenging of nitric oxide and 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, 
reducing power and cytotoxic activity in C6 glioma cells. Correlation 
coefficient and regression analysis were done by using Sigmastat version 3.1 and 
Stata statistical package respectively.
RESULTS: Rice bran methanolic extract from Njavara showed the highest 
antioxidant and cell cytotoxic properties compared to the other three rice 
varieties. IC50 values for scavenging DPPH and nitric oxide were in the range of 
30.85-87.72 microg/ml and 52.25-107.18 microg/ml respectively. Total antioxidant 
activity and reducing power were increased with increasing amounts of the 
extract. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were in the range of 3.2-12.4 mg 
gallic acid-equivalent (GAE)/g bran and 1.68-8.5 mg quercetin-equivalent (QEE)/g 
bran respectively. IC50 values of cytotoxic assay (MTT assay) were 17.53-57.78 
microg/ml. Correlation coefficient and regression analysis of phenolic content 
with DPPH and NO scavenging, MTT (-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl 
tetrazolium bromide) assay, total antioxidant assay and reducing power showed a 
highly significant correlation coefficient values (96-99%) and regression values 
(91-98%).
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that the crude methanolic 
extract from Njavara rice bran contains significantly high polyphenolic 
compounds with superior antioxidant activity as evidenced by scavenging of free 
radicals including DPPH and NO. Njavara extracts also showed highest reducing 
power activity, anti-proliferative property in C6 glioma cells. In conclusion, 
it is conceivable that the Njavara rice variety could be exploited as one of the 
potential sources for plant--based pharmaceutical products.

Overexpression of p53 protein in betel- and tobacco-related human oral dysplasia 
and squamous-cell carcinoma in India.

The aetiological factors for oral cancer are not the same in India and in 
Western countries. Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between high 
incidence of oral cancer and heavy consumption of betel and/or tobacco in the 
Indian population, while this study indicates an association with a genetic 
change. The p53 tumour-suppressor gene is the most commonly identified mutated 
gene in human malignancies. Expression of p53 protein was examined in 
premalignant and malignant oral lesions from Indian patients who were consumers 
of betel, areca nut and/or tobacco, using anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies PAb 
1801 and PAb 421. Cryosections from normal, premalignant or malignant oral 
mucosa were used for immunostaining and the observations were confirmed by 
immunoprecipitation. p53 protein was detected in 55% (15/27) premalignant oral 
lesions (leukoplakia). Strong p53-positive staining was detected in 75% (24/32) 
of oral squamous-cell carcinomas. Normal oral mucosa did not show positive p53 
staining (0/24). The detection of p53 protein in premalignant oral lesions 
suggests that p53 aberrations are an early event in the development of oral 
cancer in India. The high incidence of p53 positivity in leukoplakia may be due 
to differences in aetiological factors. p53 overexpression in premalignant oral 
lesions is important in view of the significantly earlier onset of leukoplakia 
in the Indian population compared to the development of oral malignancy, and may 
be helpful in identifying lesions that are more likely to progress to 
malignancy. The frequency of p53 protein overexpression was high in premalignant 
and malignant oral lesions of patients who were heavy consumers of betel, areca 
nut and tobacco.

Chemoprevention is a novel approach to study the anti-initiating and 
anti-tumor-promoting efficacy of medicinal plants and their active principles. 
The present study investigated the chemopreventive potential of Aegle marmelos 
fruit extract in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced skin carcinogenesis and 
its influence on oxidative stress and the antioxidant defense system. The oral 
administration of A marmelos at 100 mg/kg body weight/day during 
peri-initiational, postinitiational, and peri- & postinitiational phases of 
papillomagenesis showed significant reduction in tumor incidence, tumor yield, 
tumor burden, and cumulative number of papillomas when compared with 
carcinogen-treated control. The average latent period significantly increased 
(7.88 weeks; control group) to 9.45, 11.11, and 11.54 weeks in different A 
marmelos extract (AME) experimental groups. Enzyme analysis of skin and liver 
showed a significant elevation in antioxidant parameters such as superoxide 
dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and vitamin C in AME-treated groups when 
compared with the carcinogen-treated control. The elevated level of lipid 
peroxidation in the positive control was significantly inhibited by AME 
administration. These results indicate that AME has the potential to reduce 
chemical-induced skin papillomas by enhancing the antioxidant defense system.

The phenanthroindolizidine plant alkaloids pergularinine (PGL) and 
tylophorinidine (TPD) isolated from the Indian medicinal herb Pergularia pallida 
have been evaluated for their biological activity and assessed for the first 
time employing dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (5,6,7,8-THF: NADP(+) 
oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) as the probe in the present investigations. The 
enzyme is a key target in cancer chemotherapy and has been purified from 
Lactobacillus leichmannii. Cytotoxicity studies showed that both PGL and TPD are 
potently toxic and inhibited the growth of L. leichmannii cells (IC(50)=45 and 
40 microM, respectively). Both the alkaloids significantly inhibited DHFR 
activity (IC(50)=40 and 32 microM for PGL and TPD, respectively). Alkaloid 
concentrations greater than 75-95 microM resulted in a complete loss of DHFR 
activity. Our results are suggestive of the alkaloids as potential antimicrobial 
and antitumour compounds. Alkaloid binding to DHFR is slow and reversible. 
Inhibition kinetics revealed K(i) values of 9x10(-6) M and 7x10(-6) M for PGL 
and TPD, respectively for the enzyme and inhibition in both the cases was a 
simple linear 'non-competitive' type.

Considerable attention has been focused on plants which are sources of natural 
anti-oxidant compounds, because most of them have a modulatory role on 
physiological functions and biotransformation reactions involved in the 
detoxification process. Such compounds are likely to afford protection from 
cytotoxic, genotoxic and metabolic actions of environmental toxicant thereby 
reducing the risk for cancer. The present study reports the anticarcinogenic 
activity of Swertia chirata Buch.Ham, an Indian medicinal plant. All the four 
detoxification enzymes studied viz, GST, GPx, SOD and CAT were found to be 
activated in different degrees following treatment with infusion of Swertia 
chirata, its crude extract and a purified 'Amarogentin' rich extract. The 
activation of the enzymes was accompanied by significant reduction in lipid 
peroxidation and inhibition of incidence as well as multiplicity of 
Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced papillomas. The effect of S.chirata on 
apoptosis and cell proliferation was also studied in mice skin exposed to DMBA. 
Both the crude and purified extracts significantly inhibited cell proliferation 
and induced apoptosis. This is the fi rst report of its kind and the observation 
suggests the chemopreventive potential of Swertia chirata.

Devil's Club, Oplopanax horridus (OH), is a widely used folk medicine in Alaska 
and British Columbia for treating a variety of ailments including arthritis, 
fever and diabetes. HPLC profiling shows that numerous compounds are present in 
the 70% ethanolic extract of OH dry root bark powder. OH extract inhibited K562, 
HL60, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cell growth with the 50% inhibition (IC(50)) estimated 
at 1/2700, 1/1700, 1/500 and 1/2500 dilutions, respectively. Non-cytotoxic 
concentrations (<IC(50)) of OH extract combined with non-cytotoxic 
concentrations (<IC(50)) of camptothecin (CAM) or paclitaxel (PTX) were tested 
on the tumor cell lines. Of the 19 combinations tested, 9 showed additive or 
synergistic anti-proliferative effect while the rest showed antagonistic effect. 
Combination of OH extract at 1/4000 and 1/16,000 dilutions with 0.1 microM of 
CAM produced additive, anti-proliferative effects on K562 cells, as did 1/2000 
and 1/1000 dilutions of OH combined with 2.5 nM of PTX on MCF7, and 1/4000 
dilution of OH with 1 nM of PTX on MDA-MB-468 cells. Combination of 1/8000 and 
1/4000 dilution of OH with 0.05 microM of CAM showed strong synergistic 
anti-proliferative effects on HL60 cells. At non-cytotoxic 1/4000 dilution, OH 
induced 13.1% of HL60 cells to differentiate into granulocytes but had no effect 
on monocyte/macrophage differentiation. A cell free hydroxyl radical scavenging 
assay estimated that OH at 1/100, 1/10 and 1/5 dilutions showed activities 
equivalent to 2.7, 15.7 and 25.6 microM of Trolox, respectively. At 
non-cytotoxic 1/4000 and 1/2000 dilutions, OH significantly reduced nitric oxide 
production by lipopolysaccharide activated RAW 264.7 cells (p<0.001). Our data 
show that the ethanolic extract of OH has anti-proliferative on several cancer 
cell lines, and has strong antioxidant activity.

Alexander cell line, an human hepatocellular carcinoma derived cell line which 
has the property of secreting HBsAg in the supernatant was used to study the 
antiviral property of phyllanthus amarus. Aquous extract of Phyllanthus amarus 
was evaluated for its in vitro ability to inhibit HBsAg secretion on a dose 
dependent manner. It was seen that P. amarus at 1mg/ml concentration on a single 
dose inhibited the secretion of HBsAg for a period of 48 hours. This experiment 
proved the anti hepatitis B virus property of P. amarus at cellular level and 
further confirmed its beneficial use in the treatment of acute and chronic 
hepatitis B and healthy carriers of HBV.

The CH3OH-CH2Cl2 extract of an Indian collection (entire plant) of Gynandropsis 
gynandra (L.) Briq. was separated based on bioassay results employing cancer 
cell lines. Six cancer cell growth inhibitors were isolated and found to be 
known flavone apegenin (4) and flavonols 1-3, 5, and 6. The structure of 
flavonol 2 was confirmed by X-ray crystal structure determination. All of the 
five flavonols (1-3, 5, 6) inhibited the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell 
line with ED50 values of 3.0, 9.2, 4.0, 0.37, and 3.9 microg/ml, respectively. 
All six of the flavonoids (1-6) also exhibited activity against a panel of six 
human cancer cell lines. Penduletin (3) inhibited growth of the Gram-negative 
pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae and apegenin (4) inhibited growth of the 
Gram-positive opportunist Enterococcus faecalis.

The study investigates the antioxidant, hepatoprotective and antiproliferative 
effects of novel icetexane diterpenoids (ice 1-4) isolated from hexane extract 
of stem bark of Premna tomentosa. A549, HT-29, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, A431 cells 
were used to assess the antiproliferative activity by MTT assay. Cell death 
induced by apoptosis was determined by morphological assessment studies using 
acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining (dual staining), mitochondrial 
potential measurement by JC-1 staining, and cell cycle analysis by propidium 
iodide staining method by Muse cell analyser. Anti oxidant activity was 
investigated by in vitro assays such as DPPH, nitric oxide and superoxide 
scavenging activities. Hepatoprotective activity was determined in vitro with 
HepG2 cells and in vivo by tBHP induced hepatic damage mice model. Based on the 
in vitro cytotoxic assays and morphological assessment studies using 
fluorescence microscopic study (acridine orange and ethidium bromide double 
staining) and mitochondrial potential measurements, it was found that ice 2 and 
3 possess good antiproliferative effect via mitochondrial mediated apoptosis in 
human lung and breast cancer cells. Results of in vitro antioxidant studies 
demonstrated that ice-4 has showed good antioxidant activity. The restoration of 
serum levels of SGOT, SGPT and ALKP, liver GSH status and reduction or 
inhibition of lipid peroxidation in liver of tBHP intoxicated mice after 
administration of ice-4 at dose of 250mg/kg indicated its potential use for 
hepatoprotective activity.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of deaths in women globally. Present 
communication deals with design and synthesis of a few diarylnaphthyls as 
possible anti-breast cancer agents. Among the thirty three representatives with 
significant antiproliferative activity compounds 23 and 50 were quite 
efficacious against human breast cancer cells. Compound 50 induced apoptosis in 
both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and exerted S phase and G2/M phase arrest 
respectively via distinct mechanistic pathways. It showed moderate microtubule 
destabilization. Further, it exhibited DNA topoisomerase-II inhibition effect in 
MCF-7 cells. It was well tolerable and found safe up to 300 mg/kg dose in Swiss 
albino mice. The dual action antiproliferative effect of compound 50 is quite 
interesting and warrants for future development.

The antineoplastic effect of Trigonella foenum graecum seed extract has been 
evaluated in the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) model in Balb-C mice. 
Intra-peritoneal administration of the alcohol extract of the seed both before 
and after inoculation of EAC cell in mice produced more than 70% inhibition of 
tumour cell growth with respect to the control. Treatment with the extract was 
found to enhance both the peritoneal exudate cell and macrophage cell counts. 
The extract also produced a significant antiinflammatory effect. We report here 
the antiinflammatory and antineoplastic effects, of Trigonella foenum graecum 
seed extract.

Barringtonia racemosa has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment 
of various diseases. The antitumor property of the seed extract of this plant in 
mice model promotes us to search for the active component present in the fruit 
extract. Quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (QOR) has been isolated from the fruits of 
this plant for the first time and quantified by HPLC method. The compound was 
identified by IR, mass, and NMR (1D, 2D) spectral data analysis. QOR showed 
dose- and time-dependent anti-proliferative activity in several leukemic cell 
lines with negligible effect on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
(PBMC). A representative T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line 
(MOLT-3) showed phosphatidyl serine externalization and DNA fragmentation, 
indicating QOR-induced programmed cell death. We established that QOR-induced 
apoptosis occurred preferentially on accumulation of cells in the sub-G(0) phase 
and genomic DNA fragmentation through the activation of mitochondria-dependent 
caspase cascade for the first time in T-lineage ALL cell line.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Glycosmis pentaphylla (Retz.) Correa is used in 
Indian traditional medicine against jaundice and other liver disorders.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aims to determine the in vitro anticancer and 
apoptosis inducing activity of Glycosmis pentaphylla in hepatocellular carcinoma 
cell line, Hep3 B.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing activity of the 
crude extract and active fractions were estimated on Hep3 B and RAW264.7 cell 
lines by MTT assay, Hoechst staining, DNA fragmentation, morphological studies, 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and 
anti-poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase assays. The phytochemical profiling of active 
extract was done by TLC and HPTLC methods.
RESULTS: Ethanol extract of Glycosmis pentaphylla was more effective than other 
extracts in reducing the proliferation of Hep3 B cells. As revealed by the 
results from DNA fragmentation, Hoechst staining, morphological studies, RT-PCR, 
PARP cleavage and gene expression studies, active extract induced apoptosis on 
Hep3 B cell line in concentration and time dependent manner with increase in the 
Bax/Bcl2 gene expression ratio. Chemo profiling data revealed the presence of 
flavonoid in the active fraction.
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that major active component in the ethanol extract 
of Glycosmis pentaphylla is a flavonoid which induces apoptosis on cancer cell 
line, Hep3 B, by increasing the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl2 genes in a time and 
dose dependent manner.

Beta-carboline-benzoquinolizidine plant alkaloid deoxytubulosine (DTB) was 
evaluated and assessed for the first time for its biochemical and biological 
activity employing the biomarker dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 
(5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate: NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) as the probe 
enzyme, a key target in cancer chemotherapy. DHFR, employed in the present 
investigations was purified from Lactobacillus leichmannii. DTB, isolated from 
the Indian medicinal plant Alangium lamarckii was demonstrated to exhibit potent 
cytotoxicity. The alkaloid potently inhibited the cell growth of L. leichmannii 
and the cellular enzyme activity of DHFR (IC50=40 and 30 microM for the cell 
growth and enzyme inhibitions, respectively). DTB concentrations >75 microM 
resulted in a total loss of the DHFR activity, thus suggesting that the 
beta-carboline-benzoquinolizidine plant alkaloid is a promising potential 
antitumor agent. Our results are also suggestive of its potential antimicrobial 
activity. DTB binding to DHFR appears to be slow and reversible. Inhibition 
kinetics revealed that DHFR has a Ki value of 5x10(-6) M for DTB and that the 
enzyme inhibition is a simple linear 'non-competitive' type.

Extracts from certain Mexican Indian medicinal plants used in traditional 
indigenous medicine for the treatment of inflammations contain sequiterpene 
lactones (SLs), which specifically inhibit the transcription factor NF-kappa B 
(Bork, P. M., Schmitz, M. L., Kuhnt, M., Escher, C., and Heinrich, M. (1997) 
FEBS Lett. 402, 85-90). Here we show that SLs prevented the activation of 
NF-kappa B by different stimuli such as phorbol esters, tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha, ligation of the T-cell receptor, and hydrogen peroxide in various 
cell types. Treatment of cells with SLs prevented the induced degradation of I 
kappa B-alpha and I kappa B-beta by all these stimuli, suggesting that they 
interfere with a rather common step in the activation of NF-kappa B. SLs did 
neither interfere with DNA binding activity of activated NF-kappa B nor with the 
activity of the protein tyrosine kinases p59fyn and p60arc. Micromolar amounts 
of SLs prevented the induced expression of the NF-kappa B target gene 
intracellular adhesion molecule 1. Inhibition of NF-kappa B by SLs resulted in 
an enhanced cell killing of murine fibroblast cells by tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha. SLs lacking an exomethylene group in conjugation with the lactone 
function displayed no inhibitory activity on NF-kappa B. The analysis of the 
cellular redox state by fluorescence-activated cell sorter showed that the SLs 
had no direct or indirect anti-oxidant properties.

A chemical investigation of an ethyl acetate extract of the Red Sea soft coral 
Sarcophyton glaucum has led to the isolation of two peroxide diterpenes, 11(S) 
hydroperoxylsarcoph-12(20)-ene (1), and 12(S)-hydroperoxylsarcoph-10-ene (2), as 
well as 8-epi-sarcophinone (3). In addition to these three new compounds, two 
known structures were identified including: ent-sarcophine (4) and sarcophine 
(5). Structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, with the relative 
configuration of 1 and 2 confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Isolated compounds were 
found to be inhibitors of cytochrome P₄₅₀ 1A activity as well as inducers of 
glutathione S-transferases (GST), quinone reductase (QR), and epoxide hydrolase 
(mEH) establishing chemo-preventive and tumor anti-initiating activity for these 
characterized metabolites.

When administered orally, Phyllanthus emblica, an excellent source of vitamin C 
(ascorbate), has been found to enhance natural killer (NK) cell activity and 
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in syngeneic BALB/c mice, 
bearing Dalton's lymphoma ascites (DLA) tumor. P. emblica elicited a 2-fold 
increase in splenic NK cell activity on day 3 post tumor inoculation. Enhanced 
activity was highly significant on days 3, 5, 7 and 9 after tumor inoculation 
with respect to the untreated tumor bearing control. A significant enhancement 
in ADCC was documented on days 3, 7, 9, 11 and 13 in drug treated mice as 
compared to the control. An increase in life span (ILS) of 35% was recorded in 
tumor bearing mice treated with P. emblica. This increased survival was 
completely abrogated when NK cell and killer (K) cell activities were depleted 
either by cyclophosphamide or anti-asialo-GM1 antibody treatment. These results 
indicate: (a) an absolute requirement for a functional NK cell or K cell 
population in order that P. emblica can exert its effect on tumor bearing 
animals, and (b) the antitumor activity of P. emblica is mediated primarily 
through the ability of the drug to augment natural cell mediated cytotoxicity.

The sesquiterpene parthenolide (PRT) is an active component of Mexican-Indian 
medicinal plants and also of the common herb of European origin feverfew. PRT is 
considered to be a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB. Human leukemic HL-60, 
Jurkat, and Jurkat IkappaBalphaM cells, the latter expressing a 
dominant-negative IkappaBalpha and thus having non-functional NF-kappaB, were 
treated with PRT and activation of caspases, plasma membrane integrity, DNA 
fragmentation, chromatin condensation (probed by DNA susceptibility to 
denaturation), and changes in cell morphology were determined. As a positive 
control for apoptosis cells were treated with topotecan (TPT) and H2O2. At 2-8 
microM concentration PRT induced transient cell arrest in G2 and M followed by 
apoptosis. A narrow range of PRT concentration (2-10 microM) spanned its 
cytostatic effect, induction of apoptosis and induction of necrosis. In fact, 
necrotic cells were often seen concurrently with apoptotic cells at the same PRT 
concentration. Atypical apoptosis was characterized by loss of plasma membrane 
integrity very shortly after caspases activation. In contrast, a prolonged phase 
of caspase activation with preserved integrity of plasma membrane was seen 
during apoptosis induced by TPT or H2O2. Necrosis induced by PRT was also 
atypical, characterized by rapid rupture of plasma membrane and no increase in 
DNA susceptibility to denaturation. Using Jurkat cells with inactive NF-kappaB 
we demonstrate that cell cycle arrest and the mode of cell death induced by PRT 
were not caused by inhibition of NF-kappaB. The data suggest that regardless of 
caspase activation PRT targets plasma membrane causing its destruction. A 
caution, therefore, should be exercised in interpreting data of the experiments 
in which PRT is used with the intention to specifically prevent activation of 
NF-kappaB.

Lupeol, present in fruits and medicinal plants, is a biologically active 
compound that has been shown to have various pharmacological properties in 
experimental studies. In the present study, we demonstrated the modulatory 
effect of lupeol on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced alterations on 
cell proliferation in the skin of Swiss albino mice. Lupeol treatment showed 
significant (p < 0.05) preventive effects with marked inhibition at 48, 72, and 
96 h against DMBA-mediated neoplastic events. Cell-cycle analysis showed that 
lupeol-induced G2/M-phase arrest (16-37%) until 72 h, and these inhibitory 
effects were mediated through inhibition of the cyclin-B-regulated signaling 
pathway involving p53, p21/WAF1, cdc25C, cdc2, and cyclin-B gene expression. 
Further lupeol-induced apoptosis was observed, as shown by an increased sub-G1 
peak (28%) at 96 h, with upregulation of bax and caspase-3 genes and 
downregulation of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 and survivin genes. Thus, our results 
indicate that lupeol has novel anti-proliferative and apoptotic potential that 
may be helpful in designing strategies to fight skin cancer.

Flavonolignans isolated from Hydnocarpus wightiana seeds, namely hydnowightin, 
hydnocarpin, and neohydnocarpin, demonstrated potent hypolipidemic activity in 
mice, lowering both serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels at 8 mg/kg/day ip. 
Hydnowightin demonstrated the best lipid-lowering effect of the three compounds. 
Good anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activity was demonstrated by 
hydnocarpin in mice in vivo. The other two derivatives were not as active in 
these screens. Cytotoxicity against the growth of murine and human tissue 
cultured cells was shown. All three compounds were moderately active against 
murine L-1210 leukemia growth. All three compounds demonstrated good activity 
against the growth of human KB nasopharynx, colon adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, 
and HeLa-S3 uterine growth. Hydnocarpin was the only compound of the three which 
was active against glioma growth. Hydnocarpin and neohydnocarpin demonstrated 
significant activity against Tmolt3 leukemia cell growth.

An efficient regioselective synthesis of polycyclic diheteroaryl[b,d]pyrans and 
diheteroaryl[c,e][1,2]diazepines has been reported through ring transformation 
reactions of 2-oxo-2,5-dihydrothiochromeno[4,3-b]pyrans (3,4), 
2-oxo-5,6-dihydro-2H-benzo[b]pyrano[2,3-d]oxepine/thiepine (8, 9) and 
6-oxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyrano[2,3-d]oxepine (15) by hydrazine, at 
ambient and reflux temperature. Nine compounds viz 5a,b; 10a,c,d; 12b; 13b; 16 
and 1-methylthio-5,6-dihydrobenzo[f]quinoline (0.1-100 μM) were screened for 
their cytotoxicity in normal (IEC-6), carcinoma (Colo-205) and HepG2 cell lines. 
None of the compounds showed cytotoxicity in normal IEC-6 cells while 10a,d and 
16 resulted in killing of Colo-205 cells with IC50 ranging 20-60 μM while 10c 
and 13b caused killing of HepG2 cells with IC50 values ranging 60-80 μM 
concentration. Further, 10a,d and 16 caused apoptosis through a cascade of 
mitochondrial pathway in Colo-205 cells indicating anticancerous potential 
against intestinal cancer. Interestingly, compounds 10c and 13b exhibited 
apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway in HepG2 cells suggesting anticancer 
activity against hepatic cancer.
