Lethality due to dengue infection is a global threat. Nearly 400 million people 
are affected every year, which approximately costs 500 million dollar for 
surveillance and vector control itself. Many investigations on 
structure-function relationship of proteins expressed by the dengue virus are 
being made for more than a decade and had come up with many reports on small 
molecule drug discovery. In this review, we present a detailed note on viral 
proteins and their functions as well as the inhibitors discovered/designed so 
far using experimental and computational methods. Further, the phytoconstituents 
from medicinal plants, specifically the extract of the papaya leaves, neem and 
bael, which combat dengue infection via dengue protease, helicase, methyl 
transferase and polymerase will be summarized.
