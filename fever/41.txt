Medicine among the ancient Maya.

Garcia-Kutzbach A.

Medicine among the ancient Mayas was a blend of religion and science. It was 
practiced by priests who inherited their position and received extensive 
education. The Mayas sutured wounds with human hair, reduced fractures, and used 
casts. They were skillful dental surgeons and made prostheses from jade and 
turquoise and filled teeth with iron pyrite. Three clinical diseases, pinta, 
leishmaniasis, and yellow fever, and several psychiatric syndromes were 
described.
