BACKGROUND: In this article we present the plants used for the treatment of 
malaria and associated symptoms in Santa Isabel do Rio Negro in the Brazilian 
Amazon. The region has important biological and cultural diversities including 
more than twenty indigenous ethnic groups and a strong history in traditional 
medicine.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to survey information in the Baniwa, Baré, 
Desana, Piratapuia, Tariana, Tukano, Tuyuca and Yanomami ethnic communities and 
among caboclos (mixed-ethnicity) on (a) plant species used for the treatment of 
malaria and associated symptoms, (b) dosage forms and (c) distribution of these 
anti-malarial plants in the Amazon.
METHODS: Information was obtained through classical ethnobotanical and 
ethnopharmacological methods from interviews with 146 informants in Santa Isabel 
municipality on the upper Negro River, Brazil.
RESULTS: Fifty-five mainly native neotropical plant species from 34 families 
were in use. The detailed uses of these plants were documented. The result was 
187 records (64.5%) of plants for the specific treatment of malaria, 51 records 
(17.6%) of plants used in the treatment of liver problems and 29 records (10.0%) 
of plants used in the control of fevers associated with malaria. Other uses 
described were blood fortification ('dar sangue'), headache and prophylaxis. 
Most of the therapeutic preparations were decoctions and infusions based on stem 
bark, root bark and leaves. These were administered by mouth. In some cases, 
remedies were prepared with up to three different plant species. Also, plants 
were used together with other ingredients such as insects, mammals, gunpowder 
and milk.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study on the anti-malarial plants from this region 
of the Amazon. Aspidosperma spp. and Ampelozizyphus amazonicus Ducke were the 
most cited species in the communities surveyed. These species have experimental 
proof supporting their anti-malarial efficacy. The dosage of the therapeutic 
preparations depends on the kind of plant, quantity of plant material available, 
the patient's age (children and adults) and the local expert. The treatment time 
varies from a single dose to up to several weeks. Most anti-malarial plants are 
domesticated or grow spontaneously. They are grown in home gardens, open areas 
near the communities, clearings and secondary forests, and wild species grow in 
areas of seasonally flooded wetlands and terra firme ('solid ground') forest, in 
some cases in locations that are hard to access. Traditional knowledge of plants 
was found to be falling into disuse presumably as a consequence of the local 
official health services that treat malaria in the communities using commercial 
drugs. Despite this, some species are used in the prevention of this disease and 
also in the recovery after using conventional anti-malarial drugs.
