One of the numerous problems created by the gold rush which took place in 
northern Brazil (Roraima State) at the end of the 1980s was a severe epidemic of 
malaria amongst the indigenous peoples of the region. Worst hit were the 
Yanomami Indians, who had lived in almost total isolation prior to this event. 
The problem has been exacerbated by the development of chloroquine-resistant 
strains of Plasmodium falciparum. In an effort to identify viable alternatives 
to dependence on western medicine for malaria treatment, a survey was carried 
out on the local plant species (wild and cultivated) used for this purpose in 
Roraima. Fieldwork was carried out amongst seven indigenous peoples, as well as 
with the non-indigenous settlers. Over 90 species were collected, many of which 
have been cited as used for treatment of malaria and fevers elsewhere. Knowledge 
of antimalarial plants was found to vary greatly between the communities, and in 
some cases there was evidence of recent experimentation. Initial screening of 
plant extracts has shown a high incidence of significant antimalarial activity 
amongst the species collected.
