In the recent years, the interest and research in medicinal plants have 
increased in a great deal. Ayurvedic medicines and formulations developed from 
ancient Indian herbal systems are renowned for their various important 
applications. Berberis aristata - an Indian medicinal plant, which belongs to 
the family Berberidaceae is an ayurvedic herb used since ancient times. It is 
also known as Indian berberi, Daruharidra, Daruhaldi, Darvi and Chitra. The 
plant is useful as anti-pyretic, anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, 
anti-hepatotoxic, anti-hyperglycaemic, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and 
anti-lipidemic agent. B. aristata extracts and its formulations are also useful 
in the treatment of diarrhoea, haemorrhoids, gynaecological disorders, HIV-AIDS, 
osteoporosis, diabetes, eye and ear infections, wound healing, jaundice, skin 
diseases and malarial fever. This review aims to highlight the ethnobotany, 
pharmacognosy and pharmacological uses of B. aristata which will give insights 
in developing potentially new bioactives from the plant scaffolds. This review 
will also highlight the patenting trends, the new compositions developed using 
the actives from B. aristata and the different assignees involved in filing 
patents.
