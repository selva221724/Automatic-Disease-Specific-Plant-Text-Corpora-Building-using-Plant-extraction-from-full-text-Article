Aqueous and methanol extracts of fresh leaves of twenty desert plants of 
Rajasthan state were tested for their antibacterial activity against human 
pathogenic bacteria Salmonella typhi, causal organism of typhoid fever in human 
beings. 10% concentrate extracts of leaves of various plant species were used 
for testing antibacterial potential. Five plant species were found to have 
inhibitory effect against the organism. Fagonia cretica leaf extracts were found 
most effective against Salmonella typhi.
