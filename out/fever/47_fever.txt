respiratory ailments were treated with bark of Abies grandis, Arbutus menziesii, 
Cornus nuttallii, Prunus emarginata, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Quercus garryana; 
digestive tract ailments with the bark of Abies grandis, Alnus rubra, Arbutus 
menziesii, Malus fusca. Oemleria cerasiformis, Populus tremuloides, Pseudotsuga 
menziesii, Rhamnus purshianus and Rubus spectabilis; gynaecological problems 
with bark of Abies grandis, Arbutus menziesii, Populus tremuloides, Prunus 
emarginata, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Sambucus racemosa; and dermatological 
complaints with the bark of Mahonia spp., Rubus spectabilis, and Symphoricarpos 
albus. Tree barks have also been used to treat fevers, diabetes, kidney
