Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology and is 
mainly characterized by the progressive erosion of cartilage leading to chronic 
polyarthritis and joint distortion. Although the exact pathogenesis of the 
disease has yet not been elucidated, however, studies suggest that cellular 
proliferation of synoviocytes result in pannus formation which damages the 
cartilage and bone. Recent reports also support the role of free radicals in its 
pathogenesis. Apart from the conventional treatment strategies using 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and 
glucocorticoids, newer and safer drugs are continuously being searched, as long 
term usage of these drugs have resulted in adverse effects. Alternative medicine 
provides another approach for treatment of RA and currently a number of 
medicinal plants are under scientific evaluation to develop a novel drug. There 
is a dire need to investigate the complete therapeutic potential and adverse 
effects, if any, of these herbals for providing newer and safer treatment 
options with minimum side effects. In this review we have tried to explore 
various Indian ancient Ayurvedic, Unani and Tibbi, as also some Chinese and 
Korean, herbals for their potential to treat RA.
