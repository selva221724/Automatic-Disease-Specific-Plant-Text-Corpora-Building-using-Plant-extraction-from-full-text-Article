Aavirai Kudineer (AK) is an herbal decoction of seven botanical drugs, cited in 
the Gunapadam; a Tamil Siddha medical text. The anti-diabetic efficacy of this 
formulation was evaluated using alloxan-induced diabetic and normal rats. 
Glucose tolerance was observed within 1 hr in AK-treated rats (10 ml/kg body ) 
as compared to control. A significant decrease in the severe hyperglycemia 
characteristic of alloxan diabetes was noted after 15 days of AK treatment. 
Further AK treatment reversed the elevated urea, creatinine, cholesterol and 
decreased protein values to near normal levels. Assay of glycogen content and 
chief carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, viz. hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase 
and fructose 1,6 diphosphatase in the liver of diabetic and AK-treated diabetic 
rats clearly ascertains the hypoglycemic efficacy of this formulation. The mode 
of action of this herbal formulation remains to be elucidated.
