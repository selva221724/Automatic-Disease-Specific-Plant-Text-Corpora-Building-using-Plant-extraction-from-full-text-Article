Eleven antidiabetic Indian medicinal plants were investigated in streptozotocin 
induced diabetic rat model and provided scientific validation to prove their 
antihyperglycemic activity. Antidiabetic principles from five plants were 
isolated. All the compounds isolated were evaluated for antihyperglycemic 
activity in streptozotocin induced diabetic rat model and activities were 
compared with standard drug metformin. Some compounds were also screened in 
db/db mice. Two compounds (PP-1 and PP-2) inhibited significantly the activity 
of PTPase-1B in an in vitro system. This might be the underlying mechanism of 
antihyperglycemic activity of these compounds.
