BACKGROUND: Plants have been used to treat health disorders and prevent diseases 
since antiquity in all civilizations including the Indian and Chinse 
civilizations. Giloy (Tinospora cordifolia L.) is one of the most important 
medicinal plants in Indian folk medicine and is commonly known as the 
"Heart-leaved Moonseed" or "Guduchi". Giloy is a perennial shrubby creeper of 
the family Menispermaceae. It is native to the tropical areas of India, Sri 
Lanka, Myanmar, Sothern Eastern Asia, Africa, and Australia. It attracted 
attention in the last few decades because its roots, stems, and leaves are used 
in folk medicine treating several disorders.
METHODS: To reveal its potential, we reviewed the literature on this plant over 
the last five decades using several search engines.
RESULTS: Giloy is recommended in diabetes, stomachache, jaundice, urinary 
problems, skin ailments, and prolonged diarrhea and dysentery. The medicinal 
properties of T. cordifolia extracts were attributed to its phytochemical 
content including steroids, alkaloids, diterpenoid lactones, and glycosides.
CONCLUSION: In this review, we summarized the phytochemical content of T. 
cordifolia and its medicinal properties with special emphasis on its 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic activities. We aimed to provide 
natural product researchers with a full picture of the potential applications of 
this plant in the development of food additives and nutraceuticals.
