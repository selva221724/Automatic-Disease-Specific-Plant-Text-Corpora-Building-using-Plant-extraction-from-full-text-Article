Diabetes mellitus and obesity are one of the most common health issues spread 
throughout world and raised the medical attention to find the new effective 
agents to treat these disease state. Occurrence of the drug resistance to the 
insulin and leptin receptor is also challenging major issues. The molecules that 
can overcome this resistance problem could be effective for the treatment of 
both type II diabetes and obesity. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTP) has 
emerged as new promising targets for therapeutic purpose in recent years. 
Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) act as a negative regulator of insulin 
and leptin receptor signalling pathways. Several approaches have been 
successfully applied to find out potent and selective inhibitors. This article 
reviews PTP 1B inhibitors; natural, synthetic and semi-synthetic that showed 
inhibition towards enzyme as a major target for the management of type II 
diabetes. These studies could be contributing the future development of PTP 1B 
inhibitors as drugs.
