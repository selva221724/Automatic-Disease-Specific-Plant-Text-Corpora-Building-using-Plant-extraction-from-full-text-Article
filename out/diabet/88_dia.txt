The glycemic index (GI) was determined in 36 non-insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus patients who were fed 50 g carbohydrate portions of six Indian 
conventional foods, including rice, a combination of rice-legume (Bengalgram, 
peas, and greengram), and a combination of rice-dal (greengram dal and redgram 
dal -- dal is dehusked and split legume). In addition to the GI, triglyceride 
(TG) responses of these foods were also determined. A higher GI was obtained for 
rice and for rice with peas; all other combinations yielded lower glycemic 
indices. However, all the foods produced significantly lower blood glucose 
response 2 hours postprandially as compared with blood glucose responses to a 50 
g glucose load for the same group. No significant difference was observed for TG 
responses to the different foods.
