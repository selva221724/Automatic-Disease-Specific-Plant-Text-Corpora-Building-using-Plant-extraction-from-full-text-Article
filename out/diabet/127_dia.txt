Development of hypertension further exaggerated the deranged level of total 
glucuronoglycan (GAG), different fractions of GAG, activities of synthetic and 
degradative enzymes of GAG and biological sulphation observed in diabetic 
rabbits. Administration of indigenous drug preparations (nisakathakathi Kashayam 
and rasnairandadi Kashayam and its mixture) ameliorated the diabetic 
hypertensive condition by reversing these effects and thereby arrested.
