OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antidiabetic activity of chloroform extracts of Acacia 
arabica bark, Benincasa hispida fruit, Tinispora cordifolia stem, Ocimum sanctum 
areal parts and Jatropha curcus leaves.
METHODS: The chloroform extracts of Acacia arabica bark, Benincasa hispida 
fruit, Tinospora cordifolia stem, aerial part of Ocimum sanctum and Jatropha 
curcus leaves were evaluated at different doses (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight.) 
for antidiabetic potentials in alloxan induced diabetic albino rats. The 
extracts were administered for two weeks in different groups whereas tolbutamide 
(80 mg/kg body weight) was used as reference standard throughout study.
RESULTS: The result of present study showed test compounds significantly 
decreases elevated level of serum glucose and also caused to reverse the 
cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL and LDL values when compared to untreated 
diabetic rats.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding indicates that different test extracts were able to 
ameliorate the derangements in lipid metabolism caused by diabetes mellitus in 
alloxan induced diabetic rats towards normal level.
