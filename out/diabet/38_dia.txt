Euphorbia nivulia Buch.-Ham. (Euphorbiaceae) is commonly known as Indian Spurge 
Tree in English, and "Saj Thor" or "Jhanami booti" in local language. The plant 
is used traditionally in the treatment of various diseases like inflammation, 
fever, worm infection, asthma, cough, wounds and diabetes. In current study 
fresh as well as dried aerial parts of the plant and cut sections were examined, 
both macroscopically and microscopically. The study also deals with fluorescence 
analysis and phytochemical characteristics and other WHO recommended methods for 
standardization. WHO guidelines on quality control for medicinal plants 
materials were used for pharmacognostical evaluation of E. nivulia, 
phytochemical screening helps in determining the predominant classes of active 
constituents responsible for the activity. The present work will be helpful in 
identification of the fresh and dried samples of aerial parts 
pharmacognostically and anatomically. These studies will serve as a reference 
for correct identification and may be helpful in checking any type of 
adulteration. These observations will also help in differentiating this species 
from closely related species of the same genus and family.
