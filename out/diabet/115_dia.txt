OBJECTIVE: To determine if ethnic differences in elders' use of home remedies 
are explained by structured inequalities.
METHOD: Dichotomous indicators of "food" and "other" home remedies were obtained 
from a randomly selected cohort of older adults with diabetes (N=701). Analyses 
evaluated if differences in availability of care, economic hardship, and health 
status explained ethnic differences in home remedy use.
RESULTS: Differences in residential location, discretionary money, and health 
partially explained greater home remedy use among Black and Native American 
elders relative to whites.
CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic differences in elders' use of home remedies are not largely 
attributed to socially structured inequalities.
