The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of methanolic 
extracts of Aegles marmelos and Syzygium cumini on a battery of targets glucose 
transporter (Glut-4), peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma 
(PPARgamma) and phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3 kinase) involved in glucose 
transport. A. marmelos and S. cumini are anti-diabetic medicinal plants being 
used in Indian traditional medicine. Different solvent extracts extracted 
sequentially were analysed for glucose uptake activity at each step and methanol 
extracts were found to be significantly active at 100ng/ml dose comparable with 
insulin and rosiglitazone. Elevation of Glut-4, PPARgamma and PI3 kinase by A. 
marmelos and S. cumini in association with glucose transport supported the 
up-regulation of glucose uptake. The inhibitory effect of cycloheximide on A. 
marmelos- and S. cumini-mediated glucose uptake suggested that new protein 
synthesis is required for the elevated glucose transport. Current observation 
concludes that methanolic extracts of A. marmelos and S. cumini activate glucose 
transport in a PI3 kinase-dependent fashion.
