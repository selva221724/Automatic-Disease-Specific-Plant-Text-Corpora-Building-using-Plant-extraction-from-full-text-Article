The need for new therapeutics for wound healing has encouraged the drive to 
examine the nature and value of plant products. Ayurveda, the Indian traditional 
system of medicine, mentions the values of medicinal plants for wound healing. 
One of these is Pterocarpus santalinus. This article describes a pharmacological 
study to evaluate its toxicity as well as wound-healing potential in animal 
studies. Powder made from the wood of the P. santalinus tree was used to make up 
an ointment in a petroleum jelly base. No toxic effects were observed in 72 
hours. Studies were done on punch and burn wound models on normal and diabetic 
rats using the test ointment, untreated and vehicle controls, and standard 
therapy. Physical and biochemical measurements were made. The test 
ointment-treated wounds healed significantly faster. On healing, collagenesis 
and biochemical measurements yielded supportive data. These studies permit the 
conclusion that the P. santalinus ointment is safe and effective in treating 
acute wounds in animal models.
