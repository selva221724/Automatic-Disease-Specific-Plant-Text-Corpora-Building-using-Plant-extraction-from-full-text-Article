Effects of jambolan seed treatment on blood sugar, lipids and urea in 
streptozotocin induced diabetes in rabbits.

In New Zealand rabbits a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin (STZ 65 
mg/kg) elevated the levels of blood sugar to 340 mg percent, which was 
associated with glycolysis, ureamia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia 
and loss of body weight. Oral administration of jambolan seed (1 g/kg) in casein 
diet significantly lowered the elevated postmeal (1 1/2 hr after) values of 
blood sugar, cholesterol, FFA and triglyceride down to levels comparable to 
phenformin. Jambolan seed treatment failed to check ureamia. Weight loss was 
checked by phenformin and jambolan seed but the gain was not equivalent to that 
recorded in nondiabetic control. Like phenformin, jambolan seed too failed to 
control glycogenolysis in STZ-induced diabetes.
