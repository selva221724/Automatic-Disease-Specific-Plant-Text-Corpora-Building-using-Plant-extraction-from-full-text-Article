The present study was undertaken to evaluate the antidiabetic and 
antihyperlipidemic activities of Allopolyherbal formulation (APHF) consisting of 
combinations of three well known medicinal plants used in traditional medicines 
(Trigonella foenum graceum, Momordica charantia, Aegle marmelos) and synthetic 
oral hypoglycaemic drug (Glipizide-GL). The optimized combination of lyophilized 
hydro-alcoholic extracts of drugs was 2:2:1 using OGTT model. The optimized PHF 
was simultaneously administered with GL and optimized using OGTT model in 
diabetic rats and further studied in STZ-induced diabetic rats for 21 days. The 
results (serum glucose level, lipid profile, hepatic enzymes and body weight) 
were compared with the standard drug GL (10 mg/kg body wt). The optimized APHF 
(500+5 mg/kg body wt) has shown significant antihyperglycemic and 
antihyperlipidemic activities. The results were comparable with the standard; 
even better than the GL (10 mg/kg body wt) alone. The proposed hypothesis has 
reduced the no. of drug components from eight to three and dose almost 50% of 
both PHF and GL which fulfil the FDA requirements for export. Thus the developed 
APHF will be an ideal alternative for the existing hypoglycemic formulations in 
the market with an additional advantage of hypolipidemic effect and minimizing 
the cardiovascular risk factors associated with diabetes.
