Coccinia indica is a creeper which grows wildly in Bangladesh and in many parts 
of the Indian sub-continent. The plant has been used since ancient times as an 
antidiabetic drug by physicians who practice the Indian system of medicine known 
as Ayurvedha. We have conducted a double blind control trial with preparation 
from the leaves of the plant on uncontrolled, maturity onset diabetics. The 
trial lasted for six weeks for an individual patient. Out of the 16 patients who 
received the experimental preparations 10 showed marked improvement in their 
glucose tolerance while none out of the 16 patients in the dummy group showed 
such a marked improvement. This difference is highly significant (kappa 2 with 
Yates' correction = 11.7, P < 0.001).
