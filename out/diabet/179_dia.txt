Investigations were carried out to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of H. 
rosa sinensis leaves on blood glucose level and glucose tolerance using Wistar 
rats. Repeated administration of the extract (once a day for seven consecutive 
days), at an oral dose equivalent to 250 mg kg(-1), significantly improved 
glucose tolerance in rats. The peak blood glucose level was obtained at 30 min 
of glucose load (2 g kg(-1)), thereafter a decreasing trend was recorded up to 
120 min. The data exhibit that repeated ingestion of the reference drug 
tolbutamide, a sulphonylurea and the extract brings about 2-3 fold decrease in 
blood glucose concentration as compared to single oral treatment. The results 
clearly indicate that tolbutamide improves the glucose tolerance by 91% and 
extract does so only by 47%. At 250 mg kg(-1), the efficacy of the extract was 
51.5% of tolbutamide (100mg kg(-1)). In streptozotocin diabetic rats, no 
significant effect was observed with the extract, while glibenclamide 
significantly lowered the glucose level up to 7 hr. These data suggest that 
hypoglycemic activity of H. rosa sinensis leaf extract is comparable to 
tolbutamide and not to glibenclamide treatment
