Present investigation was undertaken to evaluate antihyperglycemic, 
antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant activities of Dihar, a polyherbal formulation 
containing drugs from eight different herbs viz., Syzygium cumini, Momordica 
charantia, Emblica officinalis, Gymnema sylvestre, Enicostemma littorale, 
Azadirachta indica, Tinospora cordifolia and Curcuma longa in streptozotocin 
(STZ, 45 mg/kg iv single dose) induced type 1 diabetic rats. STZ produced a 
significant increase in serum glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, very low 
density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, creatinine, and urea levels in 
diabetic rat. Treatment with Dihar (100 mg/kg) for 6 weeks produced decrease in 
STZ induced serum glucose and lipids levels and increased insulin levels as 
compared to control. Dihar produced significant decrease in serum creatinine and 
urea levels in diabetic rats. There was a significant decrease in reduced 
glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase levels and increase in 
thiobarbituiric acid reactive species levels in the liver of STZ-induced 
diabetic rats. Administration of Dihar to diabetic rats significantly reduced 
the levels of lipid paroxidation and increased the activities of antioxidant 
enzymes. The results suggest Dihar to be beneficial for the treatment of type 1 
diabetes.
