The efficacy of Momordica charantia (MC), Eugenia jambolana (EJ), Tinospora 
cordifolia (TC) and Mucuna pruriens (MP) was assessed in the prevention of 
murine alloxan dibetic cataract. Alloxan (120 mg/kg) was used as the 
diabetogenic agent. While controls and diabetic controls did not receive any 
plant extract, treated rats received lyophilized aqueous extract of MC and EJ 
(200 mg/kg p.o.), alcohol extract of TC (400 mg/kg) and MP (200 mg/kg p.o.) 
every day until 4 months. Serum glucose concentration was assessed and cataracts 
examined with both the naked eye and through a slit lamp. Of the eight animals 
in the diabetic control group, four developed cortical cataract (stage IV) by 
day 90 while the remaining four developed it by day 100. The incidence rate of 
cataract in MC, EJ, TC and MP treated groups at 120 days was only 0, 0, 1 and 2. 
Oral feeding of MC, EJ, TC and MP extracts for 1 month produced a fall of 
64.33%, 55.62%, 38.01% and 40.17%, respectively, in the serum glucose levels in 
comparison with the 48 h level. After 2 months of treatment, the respective 
values were 66.96%, 59.85%, 40.41% and 45.63%. MC and EJ prevented the 
development of cataract while the protective effect was less with TC and MP 
along with a significant reduction of plasma glucose levels (p < 0.001).
