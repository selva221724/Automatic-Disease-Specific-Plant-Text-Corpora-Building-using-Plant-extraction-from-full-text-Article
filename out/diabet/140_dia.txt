In West Indian folklore, a variety of plants are used for medicinal purposes. 
One such plant, Bixa orellana (annatto), is commonly used in the treatment of 
diabetes mellitus. Preliminary studies have shown that a crude annatto seed 
extract exhibited either glucose lowering or hyperglycaemia-inducing activity 
depending on how it was further manipulated. This present investigation sought 
to determine the effects of the glucose-lowering extract on C-peptide and 
streptozotocin-induced diabetic dogs. This annatto extract was found to decrease 
blood glucose levels in fasting normoglycaemic and streptozotocin-induced 
diabetic dogs. In addition, in normal dogs, it suppressed the postprandial rise 
in blood glucose after an oral glucose load. Interestingly, the extract also 
caused an increase in insulin-to-glucose ratio in normal dogs. Increased insulin 
levels were not due to increased insulin synthesis as after 1-h residence time 
and half-hour postprandial, decreased C-peptide levels was observed. It was 
concluded that Bixa orellana (annatto) lowered blood glucose by stimulating 
peripheral utilization of glucose, and it is possible that this glucose-lowering 
extract might be of pharmacological importance.
