The usage of Swietenia mahagoni, a popular medicinal plant in India and some 
African countries, dates back to ancient times for its curative properties in 
diseases like malaria, diabetes, and diarrhea. It is also used as an 
anti-pyretic, bitter tonic and astringent. Its pharmacological activities are 
being widely explored. Although many important groups of phytochemicals have 
been identified and isolated from various parts of the plant, most of these 
researches have been focused on seeds. Toxicological studies have established 
the safety of many of these plant extracts, and found insignificant side 
effects. Here we present a comprehensive review of all the pharmacological 
effects and constituent phytochemicals of the plant.
