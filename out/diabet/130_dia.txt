The glycaemic index (GI) and the triacylglycerol response were measured in 
thirty non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients given 50 g portions of 
five different conventional Indian meals containing semolina (Triticum aestivum) 
cooked by two different methods, or combinations of semolina and pulse (black 
gram dhal (Phaseolus mungo), green gram dhal (Phaseolus aureus) or Bengal gram 
dhal (Cicer arietum)). There were no significant differences among meals in mean 
GI except for meals based on roasted semolina or semolina-black gram dhal. 
Compared with the blood glucose response for a 50 g glucose load, only meals 
based on steam-cooked semolina and semolina-Bengal gram dhal elicited a 
significantly lower response at 1 h postprandially, and only meals based on 
semolina-black gram dhal at 2 h postprandially. No significant differences were 
found among the meals in the triacylglycerol-response.
