Administration of ethanol (95%) extract (45 mg/kg body wt/day for 28 days) of 
garlic (A. sativum) to alloxan induced diabetic (ALX-D) mice significantly 
lowered the serum glucose levels, nociceptive response in tail-flick, hotplate, 
allodynia, formalin test and relative thickness, weight of hind paw in formalin 
induced Paw oedema test, over 28 days, thus, showing the reversal trend in 
hyperglycemia and hyperalgesia compared to ALX-D mice. The reversal of 
hyperglycemia and hyperalgesia was progressive and more effective as duration of 
extract administration increased. The results suggest therapeutic potential of 
ethanol extract of garlic for anti-hyperglycemic and anti-nociceptive effects in 
diabetes.
