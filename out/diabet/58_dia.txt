Plant-derived molecules (PDMs) are known to be a rich source of 
diverse scaffolds that could serve as a basis for rational drug design. 
Structured compilation of phytochemicals from traditional medicinal plants can 
facilitate prospection for novel PDMs and their analogs as therapeutic agents. 
Rauvolfia serpentina is an important medicinal plant, endemic to Himalayan 
mountain ranges of Indian subcontinent, reported to be of immense therapeutic 
value against various diseases.
DESCRIPTION: We present SerpentinaDB, a structured compilation of 147 R. 
serpentina PDMs, inclusive of their plant part source, chemical classification, 
IUPAC, SMILES, physicochemical properties, and 3D chemical structures with 
associated references. It also provides refined search option for identification 
of analogs of natural molecules against ZINC database at user-defined cut-off.
CONCLUSION: SerpentinaDB is an exhaustive resource of R. serpentina molecules 
facilitating prospection for therapeutic molecules from a medicinally important 
source of natural products. It also provides refined search option to explore 
the neighborhood of chemical space against ZINC database to identify analogs of 
natural molecules obtained as leads. In a previous study, we have demonstrated 
the utility of this resource by identifying novel aldose reductase inhibitors 
towards intervention of complications of diabetes.
