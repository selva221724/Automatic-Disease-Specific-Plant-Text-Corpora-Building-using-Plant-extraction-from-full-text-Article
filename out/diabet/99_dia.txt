Tinospora cordifolia is widely used in Indian Ayurvedic medicine for treating 
diabetes mellitus. Oral administration of an aqueous T. cordifolia root extract 
(TCREt) to alloxan diabetic rats caused a significant reduction in blood glucose 
and brain lipids. The extract caused an increase in body weight, total 
haemoglobin and hepatic hexokinase. The root extract also lowers hepatic 
glucose-6-phosphatase and serum acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and 
lactate dehydrogenase in diabetic rats. Thus TCREt has hypoglycaemic and 
hypolipidaemic effect.
