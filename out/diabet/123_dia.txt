The present work was executed to evaluate the anti-diabetic potency of a 
polyherbal formulation, and its influence on derangement in the metabolism of 
glucose and cholesterol and changes in sodium levels in serum and urine in 
normal and alloxan induced diabetic rats. Serum glucose and serum cholesterol 
levels were found to be increased in diabetic animals. Serum sodium and urinary 
sodium, hepatic glycogen levels are found to be decreased in diabetic state. 
Treatment with the polyherbal formulation (1.0 ml/kg body wt) for 30 days in 
diabetic animals has shown decrease in serum glucose and serum cholesterol 
levels in comparison to control animals, whereas in normal treated animals, the 
formulation does not effect the serum glucose and serum cholesterol levels. 
Serum sodium and urinary sodium levels were increased in both diabetic treated 
and the control animals. Hepatic glycogen levels were increased in diabetic 
treated animals, but there was no change in the control treated animals.
